<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smc">The</span> following treatise forms a part only of
a much larger and more comprehensive work,
covering the whole ground of parliamentary
law and practice, which the author has for
some time been engaged in preparing; and
which it is his intention to complete and publish,
as soon as possible. In the mean time,
this little work has been compiled, chiefly
from the larger, at the request of the publishers,
and to supply a want which was supposed
to exist to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>The treatise, now presented to the public,
is intended as a <cite>Manual for Deliberative Assemblies</cite>
of every description, but more especially
for those which are not legislative in
their character; though with the exception
of the principal points, in which legislative
bodies differ from others, namely, the several
different stages or readings of a bill, and
<a name="png.003" id="png.003" href="#png.003"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>conferences and amendments between the two
branches, this work will be found equally
useful in legislative assemblies as in others.</p>

<p>The only work which has hitherto been in
general use in this country, relating to the
proceedings of legislative assemblies, is the
compilation originally prepared by Mr. Jefferson,
when vice-president of the United States,
for the use of the body over which he presided,
and which is familiarly known as
<cite>Jefferson’s Manual</cite>. This work, having been
extensively used in our legislative bodies, and,
in some States, expressly sanctioned by law,
may be said to form, as it were, the basis of
the common parliamentary law of this country.
Regarding it in that light, the author of the
following treatise has considered the principles
and rules laid down by Mr. Jefferson
(and which have been adopted by him chiefly
from the elaborate work of Mr. Hatsell) as
the established rules on this subject, and has
accordingly made them the basis of the present
compilation, with an occasional remark,
in a note, by way of explanation or suggestion,
whenever he deemed it necessary.</p>

<p class="nogap_btm">Members of legislative bodies, who may
have occasion to make use of this work, will
<a name="png.004" id="png.004" href="#png.004"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>do well to bear in mind, that it contains only
what may be called the <em>common parliamentary
law</em>; which, in every legislative assembly, is
more or less modified or controlled by special
rules.</p>

<p><span class="smc">This</span> edition of Cushing’s <cite>Manual of Parliamentary
Practice</cite> has annotations, etc., not
to be found in any other edition of the Manual.
The old edition of course could not be
improved upon, but there were several passages
in which the meaning could be brought
out plainer by notes illustrating them. This
has been done, and the reader will find that
the notes will assist him materially.</p>

<p>In addition the <a href="#png.163">Constitution of the United
States</a> has been added, and as not a few references
are made to it in the Manual, it will be
found to be an addition to the book not to be
despised.<!-- TN: period invisible --></p>

<p class="fakeh2">INTRODUCTION.</p>


<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.1" id="par.1">1</a>. </span><span class="smc">The</span> purposes, whatever they may be,
for which a deliberative assembly of any kind
is constituted, can only be effected by ascertaining
the sense or will of the assembly, in
reference to the several subjects submitted to
it, and by embodying that sense or will in an
intelligible, authentic, and authoritative form.
To do this, it is necessary, in the first place,
that the assembly should be properly constituted
and organized; and, secondly, that it
should conduct its proceedings according to
certain rules, and agreeably to certain forms,
which experience has shown to be the best
adapted to the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.2" id="par.2">2</a>. </span>Some deliberative assemblies, especially
those which consist of permanently established
bodies, such as municipal and other
corporations, are usually constituted and
<a name="png.008" id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>organized, at least, in part, in virtue of certain
legal provisions; while others, of an occasional
or temporary character, such as conventions
and political meetings, constitute and
organize themselves on their assembling together
for the purposes of their appointment.</p>

<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.3" id="par.3">3</a>. </span>The most usual and convenient mode of
organizing a deliberative assembly is the following:—The
members being assembled together,
in the place, and at the time appointed
for their meeting, one of them addressing
himself to the others, requests them to come
to order; the members thereupon seating
themselves, and giving their attention to him,
he suggests the propriety and necessity of
their being organized, before proceeding to
business, and requests the members to nominate
some person to act as chairman of the
meeting; a name or names being thereupon
mentioned, he declares that such a person
(whose name was first heard by him) is nominated
for chairman, and puts a question that
the person so named be requested to take the
chair. If this question should be decided in
the negative, another nomination is then to
be called for, and a question put upon the
name mentioned (being that of some other
<a name="png.009" id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>person) as before, and so on until a choice is
effected. When a chairman is elected, he
takes the chair, and proceeds in the same
manner to complete the organization of the
assembly, by the choice of a secretary and
such other officers, if any, as may be deemed
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.4" id="par.4">4</a>. </span>An organization, thus effected, may be,
and frequently is, sufficient for all the purposes
of the meeting; but if, for any reason,
it is desired to have a greater number of officers,
or to have them selected with more
deliberation, it is the practice to organize temporarily,
in the manner above mentioned, and
then to refer the subject of a permanent organization,
and the selection of persons to be
nominated for the several offices, to a committee;
upon whose report, the meeting proceeds
to organize itself, conformably thereto,
or in such other manner as it thinks proper.</p>

<p>[“In Congress, and all the lower houses of
the State legislatures, and a few of the State
senates, the presiding officer is called the
<em>Speaker</em>; while in the United States Senate
and a number of State senates the name
<em>President</em> is used.”—<span class="smc">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.5" id="par.5">5</a>. </span>The presiding officer is usually
<a name="png.010" id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>denominated the <em>president</em>, and the recording officer,
the <em>secretary</em>; though, sometimes, these
officers are designated, respectively, as the
<em>chairman</em> and <em>clerk</em>. It is not unusual, besides
a president, to have one or more vice-presidents;
who take the chair, occasionally,
in the absence of the president from the assembly,
or when he withdraws from the chair
to take part in the proceedings as a member;
but who, at other times, though occupying
seats with the president, act merely as members.
It is frequently the case, also, that several
persons are appointed secretaries, in
which case, the first named is considered as
the principal officer. All the officers are, ordinarily,
members of the assembly<a name="fn1" id="fn1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1"
 href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>1<span class="ns">]
 </span></a>; and, as
such, entitled to participate in the proceedings;
except that the presiding officer does
not usually engage in the debate, and votes
only when the assembly is equally divided.</p>

<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.6" id="par.6">6</a>. </span>In all deliberative assemblies, the members
of which are chosen or appointed to represent
others, it is necessary, before proceeding
<a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to business, to ascertain who are duly
elected and returned as members; in order
not only that no person may be admitted to
participate in the proceedings who is not regularly
authorized to do so, but also that a list
of the members may be made for the use of
the assembly and its officers.</p>

<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.7" id="par.7">7</a>. </span>The proper time for this investigation is
after the temporary and before the permanent
organization; or, when the assembly is permanently
organized, in the first instance, before
it proceeds to the transaction of any
other business; and the most convenient
mode of conducting it is by the appointment
of a committee, to receive and report upon
the credentials of the members. The same
committee may also be charged with the investigation
of rival claims, where any such
are presented.</p>

<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.8" id="par.8">8</a>. </span>When a question arises, involving the
right of a member to his seat, such member
is entitled to be heard on the question, and
he is then to withdraw from the assembly
until it is decided; but if, by the indulgence
of the assembly, he remains in his place, during
the discussion, he ought neither to take
any further part in it, nor to vote when the
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>question is proposed; it being a fundamental
rule of all deliberative assemblies, that those
members, whose rights as such are not yet
set aside, constitute a judicial tribunal to decide
upon the cases of those whose rights of
membership are called in question. Care
should always be taken, therefore, in the
selection of the officers, and in the appointment
of committees, to name only those persons
whose rights as members are not objected
to.</p>

<p><span class="unjust"><a name="par.9" id="par.9">9</a>. </span>The place where an assembly is held
being in its possession, and rightfully appropriated
to its use, no person is entitled to be
present therein, but by the consent of the
assembly; and, consequently, if any person
refuse to withdraw, when ordered to do so, or
conduct himself in a disorderly or improper
manner, the assembly may unquestionably
employ sufficient force to remove such person
from the meeting.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.10" id="par.10">10</a>. </span>Every deliberative assembly, by the
mere fact of its being assembled and constituted,
does thereby necessarily adopt and become
subject to those rules and forms of proceeding,
without which it would be impossible
for it to accomplish the purposes of its
<a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>creation. It is perfectly competent, however,
for every such body—and where the business
is of considerable interest and importance, or
likely to require some time for its accomplishment,
it is not unusual—to adopt also certain
special rules for the regulation of its proceedings.
Where this is the case, these latter
supersede the ordinary parliamentary rules, in
reference to all points to which they relate;
or add to them in those particulars in reference
to which there is no parliamentary rule;
leaving what may be called the common parliamentary
law in full force in all other respects.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.11" id="par.11">11</a>. </span>The rules of parliamentary proceedings
in this country are derived from, and essentially
the same with, those of the British
parliament; though, in order to adapt these
rules to the circumstances and wants of our
legislative assemblies, they have, in some few
respects, been changed,—in others, differently
applied,—and in others, again, extended beyond
their original intention. To these rules,
each legislative assembly is accustomed to add
a code of its own, by which, in conjunction
with the former, its proceedings are regulated.
The rules, thus adopted by the several
<a name="png.014" id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>legislative assemblies, having been renewed in successive
legislatures,—with such extensions,
modifications and additions as have been from
time to time, thought necessary,—the result
is, that a system of parliamentary rules has
been established in each State, different in
some particulars from those of every other
State, but yet founded in and embracing all
the essential rules of the common parliamentary
law.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.12" id="par.12">12</a>. </span>The rules of proceeding, in each State,
being of course best known by the citizens of
that State, it has sometimes happened in deliberative
assemblies, that the proceedings
have been conducted not merely according to
the general parliamentary law, but also in conformity
with the peculiar system of the State
in which the assembly was sitting, or of whose
citizens it was composed. This, however, is
erroneous; as no occasional assembly can ever
be subject to any other rules, than those which
are of general application, or which it specially
adopts for its own government; and the
rules adopted and practised upon by a legislative
assembly do not thereby acquire the
character of general laws.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.13" id="par.13">13</a>. </span>The judgment, opinion, sense, or will
<a name="png.015" id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of a deliberate assembly is expressed, according
to the nature of the subject, either by a
resolution, order, or vote. When it commands,
it is by an <em>order</em>; but facts, principles,
its own opinions, or purposes, are most properly
expressed in the form of a <em>resolution</em>; the
term <em>vote</em> may be applied to the result of
every question decided by the assembly. In
whatever form, however, a question is proposed,
or by whatever name it may be called, the
mode of proceeding is the same.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.14" id="par.14">14</a>. </span>The judgment or will of any number
of persons, considered as an aggregate body,
is that which is evidenced by the consent or
agreement of the greater number of them;
and the only mode by which this can be ascertained,
in reference to any particular subject,
is for some one of them to begin by submitting
to the others a proposition, expressed
in such a form of words, that, if assented to by
the requisite number, it will purport to express
the judgment or will of the assembly.
This proposition will then form a basis for the
further proceedings of the assembly; to be assented
to, rejected, or modified, according as
it expresses or not, or may be made to express
the sense of a majority of the members. The
<a name="png.016" id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>different proceedings which take place, from
the first submission of a proposition, through
all the changes it may undergo, until the final
decision of the assembly upon it, constitute
the subject of the rules of debate and proceeding
in deliberative assemblies.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.15" id="par.15">15</a>. </span>If the proceedings of a deliberative assembly
were confined to the making of propositions
by the individual members, and their
acceptance or rejection by the votes of the
assembly, there would be very little occasion
for rules in such a body. But this is not the
case. The functions of the members are not
limited to giving an affirmative or negative
to such questions as are proposed to them.
When a proposition is made, if it be not agreed
to or rejected at once, the assembly may be
unwilling to consider and act upon it at all;
or it may wish to postpone the consideration
of the subject to a future time; or it may be
willing to adopt the proposition with certain
modifications; or, lastly, approving the subject-matter,
but finding it presented in so
crude, imperfect, or objectionable a form,
that it cannot in that state be considered at
all, the assembly may desire to have the proposition
further examined and digested, before
<a name="png.017" id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>being presented. In order to enable the assembly
to take whichever of the courses above
indicated it may think proper, and then to
dispose of every proposition in a suitable manner,
certain motions or forms of question have
been invented, which are perfectly adapted
for the purpose, and are in common use in
all deliberative assemblies.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.16" id="par.16">16</a>. </span>Before entering upon the subject of
the forms and rules of proceeding, in the transaction
of business, it will be convenient to
consider certain matters of a preliminary
nature, which are more or less essential to
the regularity, dispatch, and efficiency of the
proceedings.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section I. Quorum">Section I. Quorum.<a name="fn2" id="fn2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1"

 </span></a></h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.17" id="par.17">17</a>. </span>In all councils, and other collective
bodies of the same kind, it is necessary, that
<a name="png.019" id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a certain number, called a quorum, of the
members, should meet and be present, in order
to the transaction of business. This regulation
has been deemed essential to secure fairness
of proceedings; and to prevent matters
from being concluded in a hasty manner, or
agreed to by so small a number of the members,
as not to command a due and proper
respect.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.18" id="par.18">18</a>. </span>The number necessary to constitute a
quorum of any assembly may be fixed by law,
as is the case with most of our legislative assemblies;
or by usage, as in the English House
of Commons; or it may be fixed by the assembly
itself; but if no rule is established on the
subject, in any of these ways, a majority of
the members composing the assembly is the
requisite number.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.19" id="par.19">19</a>. </span>No business can regularly be entered
upon until a quorum is present; nor can any
business be regularly proceeded with when
it appears that the members present are reduced
below that number; consequently, the
presiding officer ought not to take the chair
until the proper number is ascertained to be
present; and if, at any time, in the course of
the proceedings, notice is taken that a quorum
<a name="png.020" id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is not present, and, upon the members being
counted by the presiding officer, such appears
to be the fact, the assembly must be immediately
adjourned.<a name="fn3" id="fn3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3"

<h3 class="sect" title="Section II. Rules and Orders">Sect. II. Rules and Orders.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.20" id="par.20">20</a>. </span>Every deliberative assembly, as has already
been observed, is, by the fact alone of
its existence, subject to those rules of proceeding,
without which it could not accomplish
the purposes of its creation. It may
also provide rules for itself, either in the form
of a general code established beforehand, or
by the adoption, from time to time, during
its sitting, of such special rules as it may find
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.21" id="par.21">21</a>. </span>When a code of rules is adopted beforehand,
it is usual also to provide therein
as to the mode in which they may be amended,
repealed, or dispensed with. Where there
is no such provision, it will be competent for
the assembly to act at any time, and in the
usual manner, upon questions of amendment
<a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or repeal; but in reference to dispensing with
a rule, or suspending it, in a particular case,
if there is no express provision on the subject,
it seems that it can only be done by general
consent.<a name="fn4" id="fn4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4"
 href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.22" id="par.22">22</a>. </span>When any of the rules, adopted by the
assembly, or in force, relative to its manner
of proceeding, is disregarded or infringed,
every member has the right to take notice
thereof and to require that the presiding officer,
or any other whose duty it is, shall carry
such rule into execution; and, in that case,
the rule must be enforced, at once, without
debate or delay. It is then too late to alter,
repeal, or suspend the rule; so long as any
one member insists upon its execution, it
must be enforced.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.23" id="par.23">23</a>. </span>Every assembly<!-- TN: original reads "a sembly" -->, which is not likely to
finish its business at one sitting, will find it
convenient to come to some order or resolution
beforehand, as to the time of reassembling,

motion to adjourn.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section IV. Principle of Decision">Sect. IV. Principle of Decision.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.24" id="par.24">24</a>. </span>The principle, upon which the decisions
of all aggregate bodies, such as councils, corporations,
and deliberative assemblies, are
made, is that of the majority of votes or suffrages;
and this rule holds not only in reference
to questions and subjects, which admit
only of an affirmative on one side, and a negative
on the other, but also in reference to
elections in which more than two persons
may receive the suffrages.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.25" id="par.25">25</a>. </span>But this rule may be controlled by a
special rule in reference to some particular
subject or question; by which any less number
than a majority may be admitted, or any
greater number required to express the will
of the assembly. Thus, it is frequently provided,
in legislative assemblies, that one third
or one fourth only of the members shall be
sufficient to require the taking of a question

that no alteration shall take place in any of

 /><small>OF THE OFFICERS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.26" id="par.26">26</a>. </span>The usual and necessary officers of a
deliberative assembly are those already mentioned,
namely, a presiding, and a recording,
officer; both of whom are elected or appointed
by the assembly itself, and removable at
its pleasure. These officers are always to be
elected by absolute majorities, even in those
States in which elections are usually effected
by a plurality, for the reason, that, being removable
at the pleasure of the assembly, if
any number short of a majority were to elect,
<a name="png.024" id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a person elected by any such less number
would not be able to retain his office for a
moment; inasmuch as he might be instantly
removed therefrom, on a question made for
that purpose, by the votes of those who had
voted for other persons on the election; and
it is essential to the due and satisfactory performance
of the functions of these officers,
that they should possess the confidence of the
assembly, which they cannot be said to do,
unless they have the suffrages of at least a
majority.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section I. The Presiding Officer">Sect. I. The Presiding Officer.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.27" id="par.27">27</a>. </span>The principal duties of this officer are
the <span class="nw">following:—</span></p>

<p>To open the sitting, at the time to which
the assembly is adjourned, by taking the chair
and calling the members to order;</p>

<p>To announce the business before the assembly
in the order in which it is to be acted
upon;</p>

<p>To receive and submit, in the proper manner,
all motions and propositions presented by
the members;</p>

<p>To put to vote all questions, which are
regularly moved, or necessarily arise in the
<a name="png.025" id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>course of the proceedings, and to announce
the result;</p>

<p>To restrain the members, when engaged in
debate, within the rules of order;</p>

<p>To enforce on all occasions the observance
of order and decorum among the members;</p>

<p>To receive all messages and other communications
and announce them to the assembly;</p>

<p>To authenticate, by his signature, when
necessary, all the acts, orders, and proceedings
of the assembly;</p>

<p>To inform the assembly, when necessary, or
when referred to for the purpose, in a point of
order or practice;</p>

<p>To name the members (when directed to do
so in a particular case, or when it is made a
part of his general duty by a rule,) who are to
serve on committees; and, in general,</p>

<p>To represent and stand for the assembly,
declaring its will, and, in all things, obeying
implicitly its commands.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.28" id="par.28">28</a>. </span>If the assembly is organized by the
choice of a president, and vice-presidents, it is
the duty of one of the latter to take the chair,
in case of the absence of the president from
the assembly, or of his withdrawing from the
<a name="png.026" id="png.026" href="#png.026"><span class="pagenum"><span

proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.29" id="par.29">29</a>. </span>Where but one presiding officer is appointed,
in the first instance, his place can
only be supplied, in case of his absence, by
the appointment of a president or chairman
<em>pro tempore</em>; and, in the choice of this officer,
who ought to be elected before any other
business is done, it is the duty of the secretary
to conduct the proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.30" id="par.30">30</a>. </span>The presiding officer may read sitting,
but should rise to state a motion, or put a
question to the assembly.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section II. The Recording Officer">Sect. II. The Recording Officer.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.31" id="par.31">31</a>. </span>The principal duties of this officer consists
in taking notes of all the proceedings and
in making true entries in his journal of all
“the things done and past” in the assembly;
but he is not, in general, required to take
minutes of “particular men’s speeches,” or to
make entries of things merely proposed or
moved, without coming to a vote. He is to
enter what is done and past, but not what is
said or moved. This is the rule in legislative
assemblies. In others, though the spirit of
<a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the rule ought to be observed, it is generally
expected of the secretary, that his record shall
be both a journal and in some sort a report of
the proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.32" id="par.32">32</a>. </span>It is also the duty of the secretary to
read all papers, etc., which may be ordered to
be read; to call the roll of the assembly, and
take note of those who are absent, when a call
is ordered; to call the roll and note the answers
of the members, when a question is
taken by yeas and nays; to notify committees
of their appointment and of the business referred
to them; and to authenticate by his
signature (sometimes alone and sometimes in
conjunction with the president) all the acts,
orders, and proceedings of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.33" id="par.33">33</a>. </span>The clerk is also charged with the custody
of all the papers and documents of every
description, belonging to the assembly, as well
as the journal of its proceedings, and is to let
none of them be taken from the table by any
member or other person, without the leave or
order of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.34" id="par.34">34</a>. </span>When but a single secretary or clerk
is appointed, his place can only be supplied,
during his absence, by the appointment of
some one to act <em>pro tempore</em>.  When several
<a name="png.028" id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>persons are appointed, this inconvenience is
not likely to occur.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.35" id="par.35">35</a>. </span>The clerk should stand while reading or

<h2 class="runon" title="Chapter III. Of the Rights and Duties of the Members">CHAPTER III.<br
 /><small>OF THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE MEMBERS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.36" id="par.36">36</a>. </span>The rights and duties of the members
of a deliberative assembly, as regards one another,
are founded in and derived from the
principle of their absolute equality among
themselves. Every member, however humble
he may be, has the same right with every
other, to submit his propositions to the assembly,—to
explain and recommend them in discussion,—and
to have them patiently examined
and deliberately decided upon by the assembly;
and, on the other hand, it is the
duty of every one so to conduct himself, both
in debate and in his general deportment in
the assembly, as not to obstruct any other
member, in the enjoyment of his equal rights.
The rights and duties of the members require
<a name="png.029" id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to be explained only in reference to words
spoken in debate (whether spoken of a member
or otherwise) and to general deportment.
The first will be most conveniently noticed in
the chapter on debate; the other will be considered
in this place.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.37" id="par.37">37</a>. </span>The observance of decorum, by the
members of a deliberative assembly, is not
only due to themselves and to one another, as
gentlemen assembled together to deliberate on
matters of common importance and interest,
but is also essential to the regular and satisfactory
proceeding of such an assembly. The
rules on this subject, though generally laid
down with reference to decorum in debate,
are equally applicable whether the assembly
be at the time engaged in debate or not; and,
therefore, it may be stated, generally, that no
member is to disturb another, or the assembly
itself, by hissing, coughing, or spitting; by
speaking or whispering to other members;
by standing up to the interruption of others;
by passing between the presiding officer and a
member speaking; going across the assembly
room, or walking up and down in it; taking
books or papers from the table, or writing
there.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="png.030" id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>32<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.38" id="par.38">38</a>. </span>All these breaches of decorum are
doubtless aggravated by being committed
while the assembly is engaged in debate,
though equally contrary to the rules of propriety,
under any other circumstances. Assaults,
by one member upon another,—threats,<!-- TN: comma invisible -->—challenges,—affrays,
etc., are also high
breaches of decorum.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.39" id="par.39">39</a>. </span>It is also a breach of decorum for a
member to come into the assembly room with
his head covered, or to remove from one place
to another with his hat on, or to put his hat
on in coming in or removing, or until he has
taken his seat; and, in many assemblies,
especially those which consist of a small number
of members, it is not the custom to have
the head covered at all.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.40" id="par.40">40</a>. </span>In all instances of irregular and disorderly
deportment it is competent for every
member, and is the special duty of the presiding
officer, to complain to the assembly, or
to take notice of the offence, and call the attention
of the assembly to it. When a complaint
of this kind is made by the presiding
officer, he is said to <em>name</em> the member offending;
that is, he declares to the assembly, that
such a member, calling him by name, is
<a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>guilty of certain irregular or improper conduct.
The member, who is thus charged
with an offence against the assembly, is entitled
to be heard in his place in exculpation,
and is then to withdraw. Being withdrawn,
the presiding officer states the offence committed,
and the assembly proceeds to consider
of the degree and amount of punishment to
be inflicted. The assembly may allow the
member complained of to remain, when he
offers to withdraw; or, on the other hand,
it may require him to withdraw, if he do not
offer to do so of his own accord. The proceedings
are similar, when the complaint is
made by a member, except that the offence is
stated by such member, instead of being stated
by the presiding officer.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.41" id="par.41">41</a>. </span>No member ought to be present in the
assembly, when any matter of business concerning
himself is debating; nor, if present,
by the indulgence of the assembly, ought he
to vote on any such question. Whether the
matter in question concern his private interest,
or relate to his conduct as a member,—as
for a breach of order, or, for matter arising
in debate,—as soon as it is fairly before
the assembly, the member is to be heard in
<a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>exculpation and then to withdraw, until the
matter is settled. If, notwithstanding, a
member should remain in the assembly and
vote, his vote may and ought to be disallowed;
it being contrary, not only to the laws of decency,
but to the fundamental principle of
the social compact, that a man should sit
and act as a judge in his own case.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.42" id="par.42">42</a>. </span>The only punishments, which can be
inflicted upon its members by a deliberative
assembly of the kind now under consideration,
consist of reprimanding,—exclusion from the
assembly,—a prohibition to speak or vote,
for a specified time,—and expulsion; to which
are to be added such other forms of punishment,
as by apology, begging pardon, etc., as
the assembly may see fit to impose, and to
require the offender to submit to, on pain of
expulsion.</p>

<h2 class="runon" title="Chapter IV. Of the Introduction of Business">CHAPTER IV.<br
 /><small>OF THE INTRODUCTION OF BUSINESS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.43" id="par.43">43</a>. </span>The proceedings of a deliberative assembly,
in reference to any particular subject,
are ordinarily set in motion, in the first
<a name="png.033" id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>instance, by some one of the members either
presenting a communication from persons
not members, or himself submitting a proposition
to the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.44" id="par.44">44</a>. </span>Communications made to the assembly
are of two kinds, namely, those which are
merely for its information in matters of fact,
and those which contain a request for some
action on the part of the assembly<!-- TN: original reads "asembly" -->, either of a
general nature, or for the benefit of an individual.
The latter only, as they alone constitute
a foundation for future proceedings,
require to be noticed.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.45" id="par.45">45</a>. </span>Propositions made by members are
drawn up and introduced, by motion, in the
form which they are intended by the mover
to bear, as orders, resolutions, or votes, if they
should be adopted by the assembly. These
propositions, of whatever nature they may be,
are usually denominated motions, until they
are adopted; they then take the name which
properly belongs to them.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.46" id="par.46">46</a>. </span>When a member has occasion to make
any communication whatever to the assembly,—whether
to present a petition or other paper,
or to make or second a motion of any kind,
or merely to make a verbal statement,—as
<a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>well as when one desires to address the assembly
in debate, he must in the first place, as
the expression is, “obtain the floor” for the
purpose he has in view. In order to do this,
he must rise in his place,<a name="fn6" id="fn6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6"
 href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> and, standing uncovered,
address himself to the presiding
officer, by his title; the latter, on hearing
himself thus addressed, calls to the member
by his name; and the member may then, but
not before, proceed with his business.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.47" id="par.47">47</a>. </span>If two or more members rise and address
themselves to the presiding officer, at
the same time, or nearly so, he should give
the floor to the member, whose voice he first
heard. If his decision should not be satisfactory,
any member may call it in question,
saying that in his opinion such a member (not
the one named) was first up, and have the
sense of the assembly taken thereon, as to
which of the members should be heard. In
this case, the question should be first taken
upon the name of the member announced by
<a name="png.035" id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the presiding officer; and, if this question
should be decided in the negative, then upon
the name of the member for whom the floor
was claimed in opposition to him.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.48" id="par.48">48</a>. </span>The mode of proceeding upon such
communications from persons not members,
as are above alluded to, may be explained by
that adopted on the presentation of a petition,
which may be considered as the representative
of the whole class to which it belongs.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.49" id="par.49">49</a>. </span>A petition, in order to be received,
should be subscribed by the petitioner himself,
with his own hand, either by name or mark,
except in case of inability from sickness, or
because the petitioner is attending in person;
and should be presented or offered, not by the
petitioner himself, but by some member to
whom it is intrusted for that purpose.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.50" id="par.50">50</a>. </span>The member, who presents a petition,
should previously have informed himself of
its contents, so as to be able to state the substance
of it, on offering it to the assembly,
and also to be prepared to say, if any question
should be made, that in his judgment it is
couched in proper language, and contains
nothing intentionally disrespectful to the
assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.51" id="par.51">51</a>. </span>Being thus prepared, the member rises
<a name="png.036" id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in his place, with the petition in his hand, and
informs the assembly that he has a certain
petition, stating the substance of it, which he
thereupon presents or offers to the assembly,
and, at the same time, moves (which, however,
may be done by any other member) that it
be received; the motion being seconded, the
question is put whether the assembly will
receive the petition or not. This is the regular
course of proceeding; but, in practice there
is seldom any question made on receiving a
petition; the presiding officer usually taking
it for granted, that there is no objection to
the reception, unless it be stated. If, however,
any objection is made to a petition, before
it has been otherwise disposed of, the presiding
officer ought<!-- TN: original reads "eught" --> to retrace his steps and require
a motion of reception to be regularly
made and seconded.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.52" id="par.52">52</a>. </span>If the question of reception is determined
in the affirmative, the petition is
brought up to the table by the member presenting
it; and is there read as of course by
the clerk. It is then regularly before the
assembly, to be dealt with as it thinks proper;
the usual course being either to proceed
to consider the subject of it immediately, or
to assign some future time for its consideration,
<a name="png.037" id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or to order it to lie on the table for the
examination and consideration of the members
individually.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.53" id="par.53">53</a>. </span>Whenever a member introduces a proposition
of his own, for the consideration of
the assembly, he puts it into the form he
desires it should have, and then moves that it
be adopted as the resolution, order, or vote
of the assembly. If this proposition so far
meets the approbation of other members, that
one of them rises in his place and seconds it,
it may then be put to the question; and the
result, whether affirmative or negative, becomes
the judgment of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.54" id="par.54">54</a>. </span>A motion must be submitted in writing;
otherwise the presiding officer will be justified
in refusing to receive it; he may do so, however,
if he pleases, and is willing to take the
trouble himself to reduce it to writing. This
rule extends only to principal motions, which,
when adopted, become the act and express
the sense of the assembly; but not to subsidiary
or incidental motions<a name="fn7" id="fn7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7"
 href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>7<span class="ns">]

 class="ns">[p</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in the manner it desires, and which are always
in the same form. In the case of a motion to
amend, which is a subsidiary motion, the rule
admits of an exception, so far as regards the
insertion of additional words, which, as well
as the principal motion, must be in writing.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.55" id="par.55">55</a>. </span>A motion must also be seconded, that
is, approved by some one member, at least,
expressing his approval by rising and saying,
that he seconds the motion; and if a motion
be not seconded, no notice whatever is to be
taken of it by the presiding officer; though,
in practice, very many motions, particularly
those which occur in the ordinary routine of
business, are admitted without being seconded.
This rule applies as well to subsidiary as principal
motions. The seconding of a motion
seems to be required, on the ground, that the
time of the assembly ought not to be taken
up by a question, which, for anything that
appears, has no one in its favor but the mover.
There are some apparent exceptions to this
rule, which will be stated hereafter, in those
cases, in which one member alone has the
right of instituting or giving direction to a
particular proceeding; and an actual exception
is sometimes made by a special rule,
<a name="png.039" id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>41<span class="ns">]

more than one member.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.56" id="par.56">56</a>. </span>When a motion has been made and
seconded, it is then to be stated by the presiding
officer to the assembly, and thus becomes
a question for its decision; and, until
so stated, it is not in order for any other
motion to be made,<a name="fn8" id="fn8"></a><a title="Go to footnote 8"
 href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> or for any member to
speak to it; but, when moved, seconded, and
stated from the chair, a motion is in the
possession of the assembly, and cannot be
withdrawn by the mover, but by special leave
of the assembly, which must be obtained by
a motion made and seconded as in other
cases.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.57" id="par.57">57</a>. </span>When a motion is regularly before the
assembly, it is the duty of the presiding officer
to state it if it be not in writing, or to cause
it to be read, if it be, as often as any member
<a name="png.040" id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum"><span

before the assembly, no other motion
can be received, unless it be one which is previous
in its nature to the question under consideration,

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.59" id="par.59">59</a>. </span>When a proposition is made to a deliberative
assembly, for its adoption, the proposition
may be in such a form as to be put
to the question, and the assembly may be in
such a state as to be willing to come to a
decision upon it, at once; and when this is the
case, nothing more can be necessary than to
take the votes of the members, and ascertain
the result. But a different state of things
may and commonly does exist; the assembly
may prefer some other course of proceeding
to an immediate decision of the question in
<a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the form in which it is presented; and, as it is
proper, that every parliamentary body should
have the means of fitly disposing of every
proposition which may be made to it, certain
forms of question have from time to time been
invented, and are now in general use, for that
purpose. These forms of question may properly
be called <em>subsidiary</em>, in order to distinguish
them from the principal motion or
question to which they relate.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.60" id="par.60">60</a>. </span>The different states of mind, in which
a proposition may be received by a deliberative
assembly, and the corresponding forms
of proceeding, or subsidiary motions, to which
they give rise, in order to ascertain the sense
of the assembly, are the following:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The assembly may look upon the
proposition as useless or inexpedient; and may
therefore desire to suppress it, either for a
time, or altogether. The subsidiary motions,
for this purpose, are the previous question,
and indefinite postponement.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> The assembly may be willing to
entertain and consider of a proposition, but
not at the time when it is made; either because
more information is wanted by the
members individually; or because they desire
<a name="png.042" id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>further time for reflection and examination:
or because the assembly is then occupied with
some other matter, which has more pressing
claims upon its present attention. The usual
motions, under such circumstances, are postponement
to some future day or time, and to
lie on the table.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The subject-matter of a proposition
may be regarded with favor, but the form in
which it is introduced may be so defective,
that a more careful and deliberate consideration,
than can conveniently be given to it in
the assembly itself, may be necessary to put
it into a satisfactory form. In this case, it is
most proper to refer the proposition to a
committee.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> The proposition may be acceptable,
and the form in which it is presented so far
satisfactory, that the assembly may be willing
to consider and act upon it, with such alterations
and amendments as may be thought
proper. The motion adapted to this case is
to amend.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.61" id="par.61">61</a>. </span>It is not to be supposed that the subsidiary
motions above specified are the only
ones that have at any time been adopted or
used; or that it is not competent to a
<a name="png.043" id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>deliberative assembly to frame new motions at
pleasure; but these are the forms in most
common use, and are entirely sufficient for all
practical purposes.<a name="fn9" id="fn9"></a><a title="Go to footnote 9"
 href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> Neither is it to be supposed,
that these motions are always applied
strictly to the cases to which they most appropriately
belong; several of them are frequently
used to effect purposes, for which others
would be more proper. These misapplications
will be taken notice of, under the heads
of the several motions.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><small><span class="unjust2"><a name="Footnote9" id="Footnote9"><span class="ns">[Footnote </span

by a special rule, both as to the particular motions
to be used, and the order in which they may be
made. Thus, the rule in the house of representatives
of Congress (which is also adopted in the house
of representatives of Massachusetts), is, that, “when
a question is under debate, no motion shall be received,
but to adjourn, to lie on the table, for the
previous question, to postpone to a day certain, to
commit, to amend, to postpone indefinitely, which
several motions shall have precedence in the order in
which they are arranged.”<span class="ns">]</span>

<h3 class="sect" title="Section I. Previous Question">Sect. I. Previous Question.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.63" id="par.63">63</a>. </span>The original and proper parliamentary
use of the previous question being, as above
stated, the suppression of a main question, it
seems proper to consider it as one of the subsidiary
motions, for that purpose; although,
in this country, it has been perverted to a
wholly different use, namely, the suppression
of debate. This consideration, in connection
with the difficulty of the subject, and the importance
of a correct understanding of it,
makes it proper to devote more room to the
previous question, than needs to be given to
most of the other subsidiary motions. It will
first be considered according to its original
use and intention: and, afterwards, as used
in this country.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.64" id="par.64">64</a>. </span>There are several motions, which give
rise to questions previous in their nature to
other questions to which they relate; but the
term <em>previous</em> has been applied exclusively to
<a name="png.045" id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a motion denominated the <em>previous question</em>,
which has for its object the suppression of a
principal motion or question. This motion
was introduced into the house of commons in
England, more than two centuries ago, for the
purpose of suppressing subjects of a delicate
nature, relating to high personages, or the discussion
of which might call forth observations
of an injurious tendency. When first made
use of, the form of the motion was, <em>shall the
main question be put?</em> and the effect of a decision
of it in the negative was to suppress the
main question for the whole session. The
form of it was afterwards changed to that
which it has at present, namely, <em>shall the main
question be now put?</em> and the effect of a negative
decision of it now is to suppress the main
question for the residue of the day only. The
operation of this motion, in suppressing the
question to which it is applied, results from
the principle, that no further consideration or
discussion can regularly be had of a subject,
which it has been decided shall not be put
to the question; and, therefore, when on the
motion of the previous question, it has been
decided, that the principal question shall not
now be put, that question is disposed of for
<a name="png.046" id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the day, and cannot be renewed until the next
or some succeeding day. This is the purpose
for which the previous question was originally
invented, and for which it is still used in the
British parliament.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.65" id="par.65">65</a>. </span>But the previous question may be decided
in the affirmative, as well as the negative,
that is, that the main question shall
now be put; in which case, that question is to
be put immediately, without any further debate,
and in the form in which it then exists.
This operation of the previous question, when
decided affirmatively, has led to the use of it
for the purpose of suppressing debate on a
principal question, and coming to a vote upon
it immediately; and this is ordinarily the only
object of the previous question as made use
of in the legislative assemblies of the United
States.<a name="fn10" id="fn10"></a><a title="Go to footnote 10"
 href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> The operation of a negative decision
is different in different assemblies; in some,
<a name="png.047" id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as, for example, in the house of representatives
of Congress, it operates to dispose of the
principal or main question by suppressing or
removing it from before the house for the
day; but in others, as in the house of representatives
of Massachusetts, and the house of
assembly of New York (in the former by
usage only, and in the latter by a rule), the
effect of a negative decision of the previous
question is to leave the main question under
debate for the residue of the sitting, unless
sooner disposed of by taking the question, or
in some other manner.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.66" id="par.66">66</a>. </span>In England, the previous question is
used only for suppressing a main question;
the object of the mover is to obtain a decision
of it in the negative; and the effect of such a
decision, though in strictness only to suppress
the question for the day, is, practically and
by parliamentary usage, to dispose of the subject
altogether. In this country, the previous
question is used chiefly for suppressing debate
on a main question; the object of the
mover is to obtain a decision of it in the
affirmative; and the effect of a decision the
other way, though in some assemblies operating
technically to suppress the main question
<a name="png.048" id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for the day only, is, in general, merely to
suspend the taking of the question for that
day; either leaving the debate to go on during
the residue of the day, or the subject to be
renewed on the next or some other day. The
operation of an affirmative decision is the
same, in both countries, namely, the putting
of the main question immediately, and without
further debate, delay, or consideration.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.67" id="par.67">67</a>. </span>In order to suppress a question altogether,
without coming to a direct vote upon
it, in such a manner that it cannot be renewed,
the proper motion is for indefinite
postponement; that is, a postponement or
adjournment of the question, without fixing
any day for resuming it. The effect of this
motion, if decided in the affirmative, is to
quash the proposition entirely; as an indefinite
adjournment is equivalent to a dissolution,
or the continuance of a suit, without
day, is a discontinuance of it. A negative
decision has no effect whatever.<a name="fn11" id="fn11"></a><a title="Go to footnote 11"

extension of the previous question as an abuse. He
is of opinion that “its uses would be as well answered
by other more simple parliamentary forms,

within as narrow limits as possible.” Notwithstanding
this suggestion, however, the use of the previous
question, as above stated, has become so firmly

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.68" id="par.68">68</a>. </span>If the assembly is willing to entertain

more information than they possess, at the
time a question is moved, or desire further
time for reflection and examination, the proper
motion is, to postpone the subject to such
future day as will answer the views of the
assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.70" id="par.70">70</a>. </span>This motion is sometimes used improperly,
to get rid of a proposition altogether, as
would be done by an indefinite postponement.
This is effected by fixing upon a day, which,
according to the common course of things,
will not arrive until after the assembly has
been brought to a close. But a motion, worded
in this manner, is precisely equivalent to
a motion for indefinite postponement, and
should be so considered and treated.</p>

such postponement may be effected by means
of a motion that the matter in question lie on

motion, as already stated, occurs,
when the subject-matter of a proposition is
regarded with favor, but the form in which
it is introduced is so defective, that a more
careful and deliberate consideration is
<a name="png.051" id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>necessary, than can conveniently be given to it in
the assembly itself, in order to put it into a
satisfactory form. The course of proceeding
then is, to refer the subject to a committee;
which is called a commitment, or, if the subject
has already been in the hands of a committee,
a recommitment.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.74" id="par.74">74</a>. </span>If there is a standing committee of the
assembly, whose functions embrace the subject
in question, the motion should be to refer
it to that committee; if there is no such
committee, then the motion should be to refer
to a select committee. If it is a matter of
doubt, whether a particular standing committee
is appropriate or not, and propositions
are made for a reference to that committee,
and also for a reference to a select committee,
the former proposition should be first put to
the question.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.75" id="par.75">75</a>. </span>When a subject is referred or recommitted,
the committee may be instructed or
ordered by the assembly, as to any part or
the whole of the duties assigned them; or
the subject may be left with them without
instructions. In the former case, the instructions
must be obeyed, of course; in the
latter, the committee have full power over

parts may be committed to different committees.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.77" id="par.77">77</a>. </span>A commitment with instructions is

its different parts, or desires to make some
addition to it. The course of proceeding

questions, to be separately voted upon and
decided by the assembly. This division may
take place by the order of the assembly, on a
motion regularly made and seconded for the
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.80" id="par.80">80</a>. </span>When a motion is thus divided, it becomes
a series of questions, to be considered
and treated each by itself, as an independent
proposition, in the order in which they stand;
and when they have all been gone through
with and decided, the result will be the same,
as if motions to amend by striking out the
several parts had been made and put to the
question. When a motion for a division is
<a name="png.054" id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>made, the mover ought to specify in his motion
the manner in which he proposes to make
the division; and this motion, like every
other of the nature of an amendment, is itself
susceptible of amendment.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.81" id="par.81">81</a>. </span>It is sometimes asserted, that it is the
right of every individual member to have a
complicated question (provided it is susceptible
of division) divided into its several parts,
and a question put separately on each, on his
mere demand, and without any motion or any
vote of the assembly for that purpose. But
this is a mistake; there is no such rule of
parliamentary proceeding; a complicated
question can only be separated by moving
amendments to it in the usual manner, or by
moving for a division of it in the manner
above stated.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.82" id="par.82">82</a>. </span>It is not unusual, however, for a deliberative
assembly to have a rule providing for
the division of a complicated question (provided
it is susceptible of division) into its
several parts, upon the demand of a member.
When this is the case, it is for the presiding
officer (subject of course to the revision of the
assembly) to decide, when the division of a
motion is demanded, first, whether the
<a name="png.055" id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>proposition is susceptible of division, and, secondly,
into how many and what parts it may be
divided.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.83" id="par.83">83</a>. </span>A proposition, in order to be divisible,
must comprehend points so distinct and entire,
that, if one or more of them be taken
away, the others may stand entire and by
themselves; but a qualifying paragraph, as,
for example, an exception or a proviso, if
separated from the general assertion or statement
to which it belongs, does not contain an
entire point or proposition.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section II. Filling Blanks">Sect. II. Filling Blanks.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.84" id="par.84">84</a>. </span>It often happens, that a proposition is
introduced with blanks purposely left by the
mover to be filled by the assembly, either
with times and numbers, or with provisions
analogous to those of the proposition itself.
In the latter case, blanks are filled in the
same way, that other amendments by the
insertion of words are made. In the former,
propositions to fill blanks are not considered
as amendments to the question, but as original
motions, to be made and decided before
the principal question.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.85" id="par.85">85</a>. </span>When a blank is left to be filled with a
<a name="png.056" id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>time or number, motions may be made for
that purpose, and the question taken on each
by itself, and before another is made; or
several motions may be made and pending
before any of them are put to the question.
This last mode of proceeding, which is the
most usual as well as convenient, requires
that the several propositions should be arranged,
and the question taken on them, in
such order as will the soonest and with the
most certainty enable the assembly to come
to an agreement.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.86" id="par.86">86</a>. </span>In determining upon the order to be
adopted, the object is not to begin at that extreme,
which and more being within every
man’s wish, no one can vote against it, and,
yet, if it should be carried in the affirmative,
every question for more would be precluded;
but, at that extreme, which will be likely to
unite the fewest, and then to advance or recede,
until a number or time is reached, which
will unite a majority.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.87" id="par.87">87</a>. </span>Hence, when several different propositions
are made for filling blanks with a time
or number, the rule is, that if the <em>larger</em> comprehends
the <em>lesser</em>, as in a question to what
day a postponement shall take place,—the
<a name="png.057" id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>number of which a committee shall consist,—the
amount of a fine to be imposed,—the term
of an imprisonment,—the term of irredeemability
of a loan,—or the <em>terminus in quem</em> in
any other case, the question must begin <em>a
maximo</em>, and be first taken upon the greatest
or farthest, and so on to the least or nearest,
until the assembly comes to a vote: But, if
the <em>lesser</em> includes the <em>greater</em>, as in questions
on the limitation of the rate of interest,—on
the amount of a tax,—on what day the session
of a legislative assembly shall be closed,
by adjournment,—on what day the next session
shall commence,—or the <em>terminus a quo</em>
in any other case, the question must begin <em>a
minimo</em>, and be first taken on the least or
nearest, and so on to the greatest or most remote,
until the assembly comes to a vote.<!-- TN: period invisible --><a name="fn13" id="fn13"></a><a title="Go to footnote 13"

Transposition.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.88" id="par.88">88</a>. </span>When the matters contained in two
separate propositions might be better put into
one, the mode of proceeding is to reject
one of them, and then to incorporate the substance
of it with the other by way of amendment.
A better mode, however, if the business
of the assembly will admit of its being
adopted, is to refer both propositions to a
committee, with instructions to incorporate
them together in one.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.89" id="par.89">89</a>. </span>So, on the other hand, if the matter of
one proposition would be more properly distributed
into two, any part of it may be
struck out by way of amendment, and put
into the form of a new and distinct proposition.
But in this, as in the former case, a
better mode would generally be to refer the
subject to a committee.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.90" id="par.90">90</a>. </span>In like manner, if a paragraph or section
requires to be transposed, a question
must be put on striking it out where it stands,
and another for inserting it in the place desired.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.91" id="par.91">91</a>. </span>The numbers prefixed to the several

 </span></span></a>sections, paragraphs, or resolutions, which
constitute a proposition, are merely marginal
indications, and no part of the text of the
proposition itself; and, if necessary, they may
be altered or regulated by the clerk, without
any vote or order of the assembly.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section IV. Modification or Amendment
by the Mover">Sect. IV. Modification or Amendment
by the Mover.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.92" id="par.92">92</a>. </span>The mover of a proposition is sometimes
allowed to modify it, after it has been
stated as a question by the presiding officer;
but, as this is equivalent to a withdrawal
of the motion, in order to substitute another
in its place; and, since, as has already been
seen, a motion regularly made, seconded, and
proposed, cannot be withdrawn without leave;<!-- TN: comma broken in original -->
it is clear, that the practice alluded to rests
only upon general consent; and, that, if objected
to, the mover of a proposition must
obtain the permission of the assembly, by a
motion and question, for the purpose, in
order to enable him to modify his proposition.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.93" id="par.93">93</a>. </span>So, too, when an amendment has been
regularly moved and seconded, it is sometimes
the practice for the mover of the proposition
<a name="png.060" id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to which it relates to signify his consent to it,
and for the amendment to be thereupon made,
without any question being taken upon it by
the assembly. As this proceeding, however,
is essentially the same with that described in
the preceding paragraph, it, of course, rests
upon the same foundation, and is subject to
the same rule.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section V. General Rules relating to Amendments">Sect. V. General Rules relating to
Amendments.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.94" id="par.94">94</a>. </span>All amendments, of which a proposition
is susceptible, so far as form is concerned,
may be effected in one of three ways,
namely, either by inserting or adding certain
words; or by striking out certain words; or
by striking out certain words, and inserting
or adding others. These several forms of
amendment are subject to certain general
rules, which, being equally applicable to them
all, require to be stated beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.95" id="par.95">95</a>. </span><i>First Rule.</i> When a proposition consists
of several sections, paragraphs, or resolutions,
the natural order of considering and
amending it is to begin at the beginning, and
to proceed through it in course by paragraphs;
and when a latter part has been
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>amended, it is not in order to recur back, and
make any alteration or amendment of a
former part.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.96" id="par.96">96</a>. </span><i>Second Rule.</i>  Every amendment,
which can be proposed, whether by striking
out, or inserting, or striking out and inserting,
is itself susceptible of amendment; but,
there can be no amendment of an amendment
to an amendment: this would be such a piling
of questions one upon another, as would
lead to great embarrassment; and as the line
must be drawn somewhere, it has been fixed
by usage after the amendment to the amendment.
The object, which is proposed to be
effected by such a proceeding, must be sought
by rejecting the amendment to the amendment,
in the form in which it is proposed,
and then moving it again in the form in
which it is wished to be amended, in which
it is only an amendment to an amendment;
and in order to accomplish this, he who desires
to amend an amendment should give
notice, that, if rejected, in the form in
which it is presented, he shall move it again
in the form in which he desires to have it
adopted.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.97" id="par.97">97</a>. </span>Thus, if a proposition consists of A B,
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>64<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and it is proposed to amend by inserting C D,
it may be moved to amend the amendment by
inserting E F; but it cannot be moved to
amend this amendment, as, for example, by
inserting G. The only mode, by which this
can be reached, is to reject the amendment in
the form in which it is presented, namely, to
insert E F, and to move it in the form in
which it is desired to be amended, namely, to
insert E G F.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.98" id="par.98">98</a>. </span><i>Third Rule.</i> Whatever is agreed to
by the assembly, on a vote, either adopting or
rejecting a proposed amendment, cannot be
afterwards altered or amended.</p>

<p><span class="unjust2"><a name="par.99" id="par.99">99</a>. </span>Thus, if a proposition consists of A B,
and it is moved to insert C; if the amendment
prevail, C cannot be afterwards amended,
because it has been agreed to in that form;
and, so, if it is moved to strike out B, and
the amendment is rejected, B cannot afterwards
be amended, because a vote against
striking it out is equivalent to a vote agreeing
to it as it stands.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.100" id="par.100">100</a>. </span><i>Fourth Rule.</i> Whatever is disagreed
to by the assembly, on a vote, cannot be afterwards
moved again. This rule is the converse
<a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the preceding, and may be illustrated in
the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.101" id="par.101">101</a>. </span>Thus, if it is moved to amend A B by
inserting C, and the amendment is rejected,
C cannot be moved again; or, if it is moved
to amend A B by striking out B, and the
amendment prevails, B cannot be restored;
because, in the first case, C, and, in the other,
B, have been disagreed to by a vote.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.102" id="par.102">102</a>. </span><i>Fifth Rule.</i> The inconsistency or incompatibility
of a proposed amendment with
one which has already been adopted, is a fit
ground for its rejection by the assembly, but
not for the suppression of it by the presiding
officer, as against order; for, if questions of
this nature were allowed to be brought within
the jurisdiction of the presiding officer, as
matters of order, he might usurp a negative
on important modifications, and suppress or
embarrass instead of subserving the will of the
assembly.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section VI. Amendments by striking out">Sect. VI. Amendments by striking out.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.103" id="par.103">103</a>. </span>If an amendment is proposed by striking
out a particular paragraph or certain
words, and the amendment is rejected, it cannot
be again moved to strike out the same
<a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>words or a part of them; but it may be moved
to strike out the same words with others, or
to strike out a part of the same words with
others, provided the coherence to be struck
out be so substantial, as to make these, in
fact, different propositions from the former.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.104" id="par.104">104</a>. </span>Thus, if a proposition consist of A B C D, and it is moved to strike out B C; if
this amendment is rejected, it cannot be
moved again; but it may be moved to strike
out A B, or A B C, or B C D or C D.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.105" id="par.105">105</a>. </span>If an amendment by striking out is
agreed to, it cannot be afterwards moved to
insert the same words struck out or a part of
them; but it may be moved to insert the same
words with others, or a part of the same
words with others, provided the coherence to
be inserted make these propositions substantially
different from the first.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.106" id="par.106">106</a>. </span>Thus, if the proposition A B C D is
amended by striking out B C, it cannot be
moved to insert B C again; but it may be
moved to insert B C with other words, or B
with others or C with others.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.107" id="par.107">107</a>. </span>When it is proposed to amend by
striking out a particular paragraph, it may be
moved to amend this amendment, in three
<a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>different ways, namely, either by striking out
a part only of the paragraph, or by inserting
or adding words, or by striking out and inserting.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.108" id="par.108">108</a>. </span>Thus, if it is moved to amend the
proposition A B C D, by striking out B C, it
may be moved to amend this amendment by
striking out B only or C only, or by inserting
E, or by striking out B or C, and inserting E.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.109" id="par.109">109</a>. </span>In the case of a proposed amendment
by striking out, the effect of voting upon it,
whether it be decided in the affirmative or
negative according to the third and fourth
rules above mentioned, renders it necessary
for those who desire to retain the paragraph
to amend it, if any amendment is necessary,
before the vote is taken on striking out; as,
if struck out, it cannot be restored, and, if
retained, it cannot be amended.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.110" id="par.110">110</a>. </span>As an amendment must necessarily be
put to the question before the principal motion;
so the question must be put on an
amendment to an amendment before it is put
on the amendment; but, as this is the extreme
limit to which motions may be put upon one
another, there can be no precedence of one
over another among amendments to
<a name="png.066" id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>68<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>amendments; and, consequently, they can only be
moved, one at a time, or, at all events, must
be put to the question in the order in which
they are moved.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.111" id="par.111">111</a>. </span>When a motion for striking out words
is put to the question, the parliamentary form
always is, whether the words shall <em>stand as
part</em> of the principal motion, and not whether
they <em>shall be struck out</em>. The reason for this
form of stating the question probably is, that
the question may be taken in the same manner
on a part as on the whole of the principal motion;
which would not be the case, if the
question was stated on striking out; inasmuch
as the question on the principal motion, when
it comes to be stated, will be on agreeing to
it, and not on striking out or rejecting it. Besides,
as an equal division of the assembly
would produce a different decision of the question,
according to the manner of stating it, it
might happen, if the question on the amendment
was stated on striking out, that the same
question would be decided both affirmatively
and negatively by the same vote.<a name="fn14" id="fn14"></a><a title="Go to footnote 14"

 /></span></span></a><a name="par.112" id="par.112">112</a>. </span>On a motion to amend by striking out
certain words, the manner of stating the question
is, first to read the passage proposed to be

to be struck out; and, lastly, the whole
passage as it will stand if the amendment is

<h3 class="sect" title="Section VII. Amendments by inserting">Sect. VII. Amendments by inserting.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.113" id="par.113">113</a>. </span>If an amendment is proposed by inserting
or adding a paragraph or words, and
the amendment is rejected, it cannot be moved
again to insert the same words or a part of
them; but it may be moved to insert the same
words with others, or a part of the same words
with others, provided the coherence really
make them different propositions.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.114" id="par.114">114</a>. </span>Thus, if it is moved to amend the proposition
A B by inserting C D, and the
amendment is rejected, C D cannot be again
moved; but it may be moved to insert C E,
or D E, or C D E.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.115" id="par.115">115</a>. </span>If it is proposed to amend by inserting
a paragraph, and the amendment prevails,
it cannot be afterwards moved to strike out
the same words or a part of them; but it may
be moved to strike out the same words with

make these propositions really different from
the first.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.116" id="par.116">116</a>. </span>Thus, if in the example above supposed
the amendment prevails, and C D is
inserted it cannot be afterwards moved to
strike out C D, but it may be moved to strike
out A C or A C D, or D B, or C D B.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.117" id="par.117">117</a>. </span>When it is proposed to amend by inserting
a paragraph, this amendment may be
amended in three different ways, namely,
either by striking out a part of the paragraph;
or by inserting something into it; or by striking
out and inserting.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.118" id="par.118">118</a>. </span>Thus, if it is proposed to amend A B

inserting E, or by striking out C or D and inserting
E.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.119" id="par.119">119</a>. </span>When it is proposed to amend by inserting
a paragraph, those who are in favor of

before the question is taken; because if it is

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.121" id="par.121">121</a>. </span>On a motion to amend by inserting a

namely, by striking out certain words
and inserting others in their place, is, in fact,
a combination of the other two forms; and
may accordingly be divided into those two
forms, either by a vote of the assembly, or on
the demand of a member, under a special rule
to that effect.<a name="fn16" id="fn16"></a><a title="Go to footnote 16"

division, the proceedings are the same, in
reference to each branch of the question, beginning

<h3 class="sect" title="Section IX. Amendments changing the Nature of a Question">Sect. IX. Amendments changing the
Nature of a Question.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.128" id="par.128">128</a>. </span>The term amendment is in strictness
applicable only to those changes of a proposition,
by which it is improved, that is,
rendered more effectual for the purpose
which it has in view, or made to express
more clearly and definitely the sense which it
is intended to express. Hence it seems
proper, that those only should undertake to
amend a proposition, who are<!-- TN: original lacks "are" --> friendly to it; but
this is by no means the rule; when a proposition
is regularly moved and seconded, it is in
the possession of the assembly, and cannot be
withdrawn but by its leave; it has then become
the basis of the future proceedings of
the assembly, and may be put into any shape,
and turned to any purpose, that the assembly
may think proper.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.129" id="par.129">129</a>. </span>It is consequently allowable to amend
a proposition in such a manner as entirely to
<a name="png.073" id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>75<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>alter its nature, and to make it bear a sense
different from what it was originally intended
to bear; so that the friends of it, as it was
first introduced, may themselves be forced to
vote against it, in its amended form.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.130" id="par.130">130</a>. </span>This mode of proceeding is sometimes
adopted for the purpose of defeating a
proposition, by compelling its original friends
to unite with those who are opposed to it, in
voting for its rejection. Thus, in the British
Houses of Commons, Jan. 29, 1765, a resolution
being moved, “That a general warrant
for apprehending the authors, printers, or
publishers of a libel, together with their
papers, is not warranted by law, and is an
high violation of the liberty of the subject:”—it
was moved to amend this motion by prefixing
the following paragraph, namely:
“That in the particular case of libels, it is
proper and necessary to fix, by a vote of this
house only, what ought to be deemed the law
in respect of general warrants; and, for that
purpose, at the time when the determination
of the legality of such warrants, in the instance
of a most seditious and treasonable
libel, is actually depending before the courts
of law, for this house to declare”—<em>that a
<a name="png.074" id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>76<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>general warrant for apprehending the authors,
printers, or publishers of a libel together
with their papers, is not warranted by
law, and is an high violation of the liberty of
the subject.</em> The amendment was adopted,
after a long debate, and then the resolution
as amended was immediately rejected without
a division.<a name="fn17" id="fn17"></a><a title="Go to footnote 17"
 href="#Footnote17" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.131" id="par.131">131</a>. </span>But sometimes the nature of a proposition
is changed by means of amendments,
with a view to its adoption in a sense the very
opposite of what it was originally intended to
bear. The following is a striking example of
this mode of proceeding. In the house of
commons, April 10, 1744, a resolution was
moved, declaring, “That the issuing and
paying to the Duke of Aremberg the sum of
forty thousand pounds, sterling, to put the
<a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Austrian troops in motion in the year 1742,
was a dangerous misapplication of public
money, and destructive of the rights of parliament.”
The object of this resolution was
to censure the conduct of the ministers; and
the friends of the ministry, being in a majority,
might have voted directly, upon the motion
and rejected it. But they preferred to
turn it into a resolution approving of the
conduct of ministers on the occasion referred
to; and it was accordingly moved to amend,
by leaving out the words “a dangerous misapplication,”
etc., to the end of the motion,
and inserting instead thereof the words,
“necessary for putting the said troops in
motion, and of great consequence to the common
cause.” The amendment being adopted,
it was resolved (reversing the original proposition)
“That the issuing and paying to the
Duke of Aremberg the sum of forty thousand
pounds, to put the Austrian troops in motion,
in the year 1742, was necessary for putting
the said troops in motion, and of great consequence
to the common cause.”</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.132" id="par.132">132</a>. </span>It is a mode of defeating a proposition,
somewhat similar to that above mentioned, to
carry out or extend the principle of it, by
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>78<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>means of amendments, so as to show the
inconvenience, absurdity, or danger of its
adoption, with such evident clearness, that it
becomes impossible for the assembly to agree
to it. Thus, a motion having been made in
the house of commons, “for copies of all the
letters written by the lords of the admiralty
to a certain officer in the navy,” it was moved
to amend the motion by adding these
words:—“which letters may contain orders,
or be relative to orders, not executed, and still
subsisting.” This amendment being adopted,
the motion as amended was unanimously
rejected.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.133" id="par.133">133</a>. </span>It will be seen, from the foregoing
examples, that as the mover of a proposition
is under no restriction as to embracing incongruous
matters under the same motion; so,
on the other hand, the assembly may engraft
upon a motion, by way of amendment, matter
which is not only incongruous with, but
entirely opposed to, the motion as originally
introduced; and, in legislative assemblies, it
is not unusual to amend a bill by striking out
all after the enacting clause, and inserting an
entirely new bill; or to amend a resolution
by striking out all after the words “Resolved
<a name="png.077" id="png.077" href="#png.077"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>79<span class="ns">]

different tenor.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.134" id="par.134">134</a>. </span>It is a general rule, that, when a proposition
is regularly before a deliberative assembly,
for its consideration, no other proposition
or motion can regularly be made or
arise, so as to take the place of the former,
and be first acted upon, unless it be either,
<i>first</i>, a privileged question; <i>secondly</i>, a subsidiary
question; or, <i>thirdly</i>, an incidental
question or motion.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.135" id="par.135">135<!-- TN: original reads "137" --></a>. </span>All these motions take the place of the
principal motion, or main question, as it is
usually called, and are to be first put to the
question; and, among themselves, also, there
are some, which, in like manner, take the
place of all the others. Some of these questions
merely supersede the principal question,
until they have been decided; and, when
decided, whether affirmatively or negatively,
<a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>leave that question as before. Others of them
also supersede the principal question, until
they are decided; and, when decided one way,
dispose of the principal question; but, if decided
the other way, leave it as before.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section I. Privileged Questions">Sect. I. Privileged Questions.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.136" id="par.136">136</a>. </span>There are certain motions or questions,
which, on account of the superior importance
attributed to them, either in consequence
of a vote of the assembly, or in
themselves considered, or of the necessity of
the proceedings to which they lead, are entitled
to take the place of any other subject
or proposition, which may then be under consideration,
and to be first acted upon and decided
by the assembly. These are called
privileged questions, because they are entitled
to precedence over other questions,
though they are of different degrees among
themselves. Questions of this nature are of
three kinds, namely, <i>first</i>, motions to adjourn;
<i>secondly</i>, motions or questions relating to the
rights and privileges of the assembly, or of
its members individually; and, <i>thirdly</i>, motions
for the orders of the day.</p>

<h4 class="sect" title="Adjournment"><a name="png.079" id="png.079" href="#png.079"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.137" id="par.137">137</a>. </span>A motion to adjourn takes the place
of all other questions whatsoever;<a name="fn18" id="fn18"></a><a title="Go to footnote 18"
 href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> for,
otherwise, the assembly might be kept sitting
against its will, and for an indefinite time;
but, in order to entitle this motion to precedence,
it must be simply to “adjourn,”
without the addition of any particular day or
time. And, as the object of this motion,
when made in the midst of some other proceeding,
and with a view to supersede a question
already proposed, is simply to break up
the sitting, it does not admit of any amendment
by the addition of a particular day, or
in any other manner; though, if a motion to
adjourn is made, when no other business is
before the assembly, it may be amended like
other questions.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>82<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.138" id="par.138">138</a>. </span>A motion to adjourn is merely “that
this assembly do now adjourn;” and, if it is
carried in the affirmative, the assembly is adjourned
to the next sitting day; unless it has
previously come to a resolution, that, on rising,
it will adjourn to a particular day; in
which case, it is adjourned to that day.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.139" id="par.139">139</a>. </span>An adjournment without day, that
is, without any time being fixed for reassembling,
would, in the case of any other than a
legislative assembly, be equivalent to a dissolution.<a name="fn19" id="fn19"></a><a title="Go to footnote 19"

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.140" id="par.140">140</a>. </span>When a question is interrupted by an
adjournment, before any vote or question has
been taken upon it, it is thereby removed
from before the assembly, and will not stand
before it, as a matter of course, as its next
meeting, but must be brought forward in the
usual way.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Questions of Privilege">Questions of Privilege.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.141" id="par.141">141</a>. </span>The questions, next in relative importance,

 class="ns">[p</span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>time being except that of adjournment, are
those which concern the rights and privileges
of the assembly, or of its individual members;
as, for example, when the proceedings
of the assembly are disturbed or interrupted,
whether by strangers or members; or where
a quarrel arises between two members; and,
in these cases, the matter of privilege supersedes
the question pending at the time, together
with all subsidiary and incidental ones,
and must be first disposed of. When settled,
the question interrupted by it is to be resumed,
at the point where it was suspended.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Orders of the Day">Orders of the Day.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.142" id="par.142">142</a>. </span>When the consideration of a subject
has been assigned for a particular day, by an
order of the assembly, the matter so assigned
is called the order of the day for that day.
If, in the course of business, as commonly
happens in legislative assemblies, there are
several subjects assigned for the same day,
they are called the orders of the day.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.143" id="par.143">143</a>. </span>A question, which is thus made the
subject of an order for its consideration on a
particular day, is thereby made a privileged
question for that day; the order being a
<a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>repeal, as to this special case, of the general
rule as to business. If, therefore, any other
proposition (with the exception of the two
preceding<a name="fn20" id="fn20"></a><a title="Go to footnote 20"
 href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></a>) is moved or arises, on the day
assigned for the consideration of a particular
subject, a motion for the order of the day will
supersede the question first made, together
with all subsidiary and incidental questions
connected with it, and must be first put and
decided; for if the debate or consideration of
that subject were allowed to proceed, it might
continue through the day and thus defeat the
order.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.144" id="par.144">144</a>. </span>But this motion, to entitle it to precedence,
must be for the orders generally, if
there is more than one, and not for any particular
one; and, if decided in the affirmative,
that is, that the assembly will now proceed
to the orders of the day, they must then
be read and gone through with, in the order
in which they stand; priority of order being
considered to give priority of right.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.145" id="par.145">145</a>. </span>If the consideration of a subject is assigned
for a particular hour on the day named,
<a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a motion to proceed to it is not a privileged
motion, until that hour has arrived; but, if
no hour is fixed, the order is for the entire
day and every part of it.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.146" id="par.146">146</a>. </span>Where there are several orders of the
day, and one of them is fixed for a particular
hour, if the orders are taken up before that
hour, they are to be proceeded with as they
stand, until that hour, and then the subject
assigned for that hour is the next in order;
but, if the orders are taken up at that time or
afterwards, that particular subject must be
considered as the first in order.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.147" id="par.147">147</a>. </span>If the motion for the orders of the day
is decided in the affirmative, the original
question is removed from before the assembly,
in the same manner as if it had been interrupted
by an adjournment, and does not
stand before the assembly, as a matter of
course, at its next meeting, but must be renewed
in the usual way.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.148" id="par.148">148</a>. </span>If the motion is decided in the negative,
the vote of the assembly is a discharge
of the orders, so far as they interfere with
the consideration of the subject then before
it, and entitles that subject to be first disposed
of.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>86<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.149" id="par.149">149</a>. </span>Orders of the day, unless proceeded
in and disposed of on the day assigned, fall,
of course, and must be renewed for some
other day. It may be provided, however, by
a special rule, as in the legislative assemblies
of Massachusetts, that the orders for a particular
day shall hold for every succeeding day,
until disposed of.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section II. Incidental Questions">Sect. II. Incidental Questions.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.150" id="par.150">150</a>. </span>Incidental questions are such as arise
out of other questions, and are consequently
to be decided before the questions which give
rise to them. Of this nature are, <i>first</i>, questions
of order; <i>second</i>, motions for the reading
of papers, etc.; <i>third</i>, leave to withdraw
a motion; <i>fourth</i>, suspension of a rule: and,
<i>fifth</i>, amendment of an amendment.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Questions of Order">Questions of Order.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.151" id="par.151">151</a>. </span>It is the duty of the presiding officer
of a deliberative assembly, to enforce the rules
and orders of the body over which he presides,
in all its proceedings; and this without
question, debate, or delay, in all cases, in
which the breach of order, or the departure
from rule, is manifest. It is also the right
<a name="png.085" id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>87<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of every member, taking notice of the breach
of a rule, to insist upon the enforcement of it
in the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.152" id="par.152">152</a>. </span>But, though no question can be made,
as to the enforcement of the rules, when
there is a breach or manifest departure from
them, so long as any member insists upon
their enforcement; yet questions may and do
frequently arise, as to the fact of there being
a breach of order, or a violation of the rules
in a particular proceeding; and these questions
must be decided before a case can arise
for the enforcement of the rules. Questions
of this kind are denominated questions of
order.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.153" id="par.153">153</a>. </span>When any question of this nature
arises, in the course of any other proceeding,
it necessarily supersedes the further consideration
of the subject out of which it arises,
until that question is disposed of; then the
original motion or proceeding revives, and
resumes its former position, unless it has
been itself disposed of by the question of
order.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.154" id="par.154">154</a>. </span>When a question of order is raised, as
it may be by any one member, it is not stated
from the chair, and decided by the assembly,
<a name="png.086" id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>88<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>like other questions; but is decided, in the
first instance, by the presiding officer, without
any previous debate or discussion by the
assembly. If the decision of the presiding
officer, is not satisfactory, any one member
may object to it, and have the question
decided by the assembly. This is called
<em>appealing</em> from the decision of the chair.
The question is then stated by the presiding
officer on the appeal, namely: <em>shall the decision
of the chair stand as the decision of the
assembly?</em> and it is thereupon debated and
decided by the assembly, in the same manner
as any other question; except that the presiding
officer is allowed to take a part in the
debate, which; on ordinary occasions, he is
prohibited from doing.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Reading Papers">Reading Papers.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.155" id="par.155">155</a>. </span>It is, for obvious reasons, a general
rule, that, where papers are laid before a
deliberative assembly, for its action, every
member has a right to have them once read
at the table, before he can be compelled to
vote on them; and, consequently, when the
reading of any paper, relative to a question
before the assembly, is called for under this
<a name="png.087" id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>89<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rule, no question need be made as to the
reading; the paper is read by the clerk,
under the direction of the presiding officer,
as a matter of course.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.156" id="par.156">156</a>. </span>But, with the exception of papers
coming under this rule, it is not the right of
any member to read himself, or to have read,
any paper, book, or document whatever, without
the leave of the assembly, upon a motion
made and a question put for the purpose.
The delay and interruption, which would
otherwise ensue from reading every paper
that might be called for, show the absolute
necessity of restricting the rule within the
narrowest possible limits, consistently with
permitting every member to have as much
information as possible, on the subjects in
reference to which he is about to vote.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.157" id="par.157">157</a>. </span>When, therefore, a member desires
that any paper, book, or document, on the
table, whether printed or written (except as
above mentioned) should be read for his own
information, or that of the assembly; or desires
to read any such paper, book, or document,
in his place, in the course of a debate,
or otherwise; or even to read his own speech
which he has prepared beforehand and
<a name="png.088" id="png.088" href="#png.088"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>committed to writing; in all these cases, if any
objection is made, he must obtain leave of
the assembly, for the reading, by a motion
and vote for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.158" id="par.158">158</a>. </span>When the reading of a paper is evidently
for information, and not for delay, it
is the usual practice for the presiding officer
to allow of it, unless objection is made, in
which case leave must be asked; and this
is seldom refused, where there is no intentional
or gross abuse of the time and patience
of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.159" id="par.159">159</a>. </span>It is not now the practice, as it once
was, in legislative assemblies, to read all
papers that are presented, especially when
they are referred to committees immediately
on their presentation; though the right of
every member to insist upon one reading is
still admitted. It would be impossible, with
the amount of business done by legislative
bodies, at the present day, to devote much of
their time to the reading of papers.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.160" id="par.160">160</a>. </span>When in the course of a debate or
other proceeding, the reading of a paper is
called for, and a question is made upon it,
this question is incidental to the former, and
must be first decided.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Withdrawal of a Motion"><a name="png.089" id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum"><span

 /></span></span></a>Withdrawal of a Motion.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.161" id="par.161">161</a>. </span>A motion, when regularly made, seconded,
and proposed from the chair, is then
in the possession of the assembly, and cannot
be withdrawn by the mover, or directly disposed
of in any manner, but by a vote;
hence, if the mover of a question wishes to
modify it, or to substitute a different one in
its place, he must obtain the leave of the
assembly for that purpose; which leave can
only be had, if objection is made, by a motion<a name="fn21" id="fn21"></a><a title="Go to footnote 21"
 href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></a>
and question in the usual mode of proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.162" id="par.162">162<!-- TN: original reads "163" --></a>. </span>If this motion is decided in the affirmative,
the motion to which it relates is
thereby removed from before the assembly,
as if it had never been moved; if in the
negative, the business proceeds as before.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Suspension of a Rule">Suspension of a Rule.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.163" id="par.163">163</a>. </span>When any contemplated motion or
proceeding is rendered impracticable, by reason
of the existence of some special rule by
which it is prohibited, it has become an established
practice in this country, to suspend
<a name="png.090" id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>92<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or dispense with the rule, for the purpose of
admitting the proceeding or motion which is
desired. This can only be done by a motion
and question; and, where this course is taken
in order to a motion having reference to a
proposition then under consideration, a motion
to suspend the rule supersedes the original
question for the time being, and is first
to be decided.<a name="fn22" id="fn22"></a><a title="Go to footnote 22"
 href="#Footnote22" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.164" id="par.164">164</a>. </span>It is usual, in the code of rules adopted
by deliberative assemblies, and especially
legislative bodies, to provide that a certain
number exceeding a majority, as two thirds
or three fourths, shall be competent to the
suspension of a rule in a particular case;
where this is not provided, there seems to
be no other mode of suspending or dispensing
with a rule than by general consent.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Amendment of Amendments">Amendment of Amendments.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.165" id="par.165">165</a>. </span>In treating of amendments, it has already
been seen, that it is allowable to amend
a proposed amendment; and that the question
on such sub-amendment must necessarily
be put and decided before putting the
<a name="png.091" id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>question on the amendment. The former is
incidental to the latter, and supersedes it for
the time being.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section III. Subsidiary Questions">Sect. III. Subsidiary Questions.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.166" id="par.166">166<!-- TN: original reads "176" --></a>. </span>Subsidiary, or secondary, questions or
motions, as has already been stated, are those
which relate to a principal motion, and are
made use of to enable the assembly to dispose
of it in the most appropriate manner. These
motions have the effect to supersede, and, in
some cases, when decided one way, to dispose
of, the principal question. They are also of
different degrees among themselves, and, according
to their several natures, supersede,
and sometimes dispose of, one another.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.167" id="par.167">167</a>. </span>The subsidiary motions in common
use are the following, namely:—lie on the
table,—the previous question,—postponement,
either indefinite or to a day certain,—commitment,—and,
amendment.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.168" id="par.168">168</a>. </span>It is a general rule, with certain exceptions
which will be immediately mentioned,
that subsidiary motions cannot be applied to
one another; as for example, suppose a motion
to postpone, commit or amend a principal
question, it cannot be moved to suppress
<a name="png.092" id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the motion to postpone, etc., by putting a
previous question on it; or, suppose the previous
question is moved, or a commitment,
or amendment, of a main question, it cannot
be moved to postpone the previous question,
or the motion for commitment or amendment.
The reasons for this rule are: 1. It
would be absurd to separate the appendage
from its principal; 2. It would be a piling of
questions one on another, which, to avoid embarrassment,
is not allowed; and 3, The same
result may be reached more simply by voting
against the motion which it is attempted to
dispose of by another secondary motion.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.169" id="par.169">169</a>. </span>The exceptions to the rule above
stated are, that motions to postpone (either
to a day certain or indefinitely), to commit,
or to amend, a principal question, may be
amended, for the reason, that the useful
character of amendment gives it a privilege of
attaching itself to a secondary and privileged
motion; that is, a subsidiary motion to
carry out and improve another may be applied
to that other, but a subsidiary motion
to dispose of or suppress another is not admissible.
Hence, the subsidiary motions
above mentioned may be amended.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.093" id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>95<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.170" id="par.170">170</a>. </span>A previous question, however, cannot
be amended; the nature of it not admitting of
any change. Parliamentary usage has fixed
its form to be, shall the main question be now
put? that is at this instant; and, as the present
instant is but one, it cannot admit of
any modifications; and to change it to the
next day or any other moment is without example
or utility. For the same reasons, also,
that the form of it is fixed by parliamentary
usage, and is already as simple as it can be,
a motion to lie on the table cannot be
amended.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Lie on the Table">Lie on the Table.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.171" id="par.171">171</a>. </span>This motion is usually resorted to,
when the assembly has something else before
it, which claims its present attention, and
therefore desires to lay aside a proposition
for a short but indefinite time, reserving to
itself the power to take it up when convenient.
This motion takes precedence of and
supersedes all the other subsidiary motions.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.172" id="par.172">172</a>. </span>If decided in the affirmative, the
principal motion, together with all the other
motions, subsidiary and incidental, connected
with it, is removed from before the assembly,
<a name="png.094" id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>until it is again taken up; which it may be,
by motion and vote, at any time, when the
assembly pleases.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.173" id="par.173">173</a>. </span>If decided in the negative, the business
proceeds in the same manner as if the
motion had never been made.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Previous Question">Previous Question.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.174" id="par.174">174</a>. </span>This motion has already been described
(<a href="#par.63">63</a>), and the nature and effect of it
fully stated. It stands in an equal degree
with all the other subsidiary motions, except
the motion to lie on the table; and, consequently,
if first moved, is not subject to be
superseded by a motion to postpone, commit
or amend.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.175" id="par.175">175</a>. </span>If the previous question is moved before
the others above mentioned, and put to
the question, it has the effect to prevent
those motions from being made at all; for, if
decided affirmatively, to wit, that the main
question shall now be put, it would of course
be contrary to the decision of the assembly,
and therefore against order, to postpone,
commit, or amend; and if decided negatively,
to wit, that the main question shall
not now be put, this takes the main question
<a name="png.095" id="png.095" href="#png.095"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>out of the possession of the assembly, for the
day, so that there is then nothing before it to
postpone, commit, or amend.<a name="fn23" id="fn23"></a><a title="Go to footnote 23"

<h4 class="sect" title="Postponement">Postponement.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.176" id="par.176">176</a>. </span>The motion to postpone is either indefinite,
or to a day certain; and, in both
these forms, maybe amended; in the former,
by making it to a day certain,—in the latter,
by substituting one day for another. But,
in the latter case, propositions to substitute
different days for that originally named, bear
more resemblance to propositions for filling
blanks, than they do to amendments, and
should be considered and treated accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.177" id="par.177">177</a>. </span>If, therefore, a motion is made for an
indefinite postponement, it may be moved to
amend the motion, by making it to a day certain.
If any other day is desired, it may be
moved as an amendment to the amendment;
or it may be moved as an independent motion,
when the amendment has been rejected.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.096" id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>98<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.178" id="par.178">178</a>. </span>If a motion is made for a postponement
to a day certain, it may be amended by
the substitution of a different day; but in
this case, a more simple and effectual mode
of proceeding is to consider the day as a
blank, to be filled in the usual manner, beginning
with the longest time.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.179" id="par.179">179</a>. </span>This motion stands in the same degree
with motions for the previous question,—to
commit,—and to amend; and, if first
made, is not susceptible of being superseded
by them.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.180" id="par.180">180</a>. </span>If a motion for postponement is decided
affirmatively, the proposition to which
it is applied is removed from before the assembly,
with all its appendages and incidents,
and consequently there is no ground for either
of the other subsidiary motions; if decided
negatively, that the proposition shall not be
postponed, that question may then be suppressed
by the previous question, or committed,
or amended.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Commitment">Commitment.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.181" id="par.181">181</a>. </span>A motion to commit, or recommit
(which is the term used when the proposition
has already been once committed), may be
<a name="png.097" id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>amended, by the substitution of one kind of
committee for another, or be enlarging or
diminishing the number of the members of
the committee, as originally proposed, or by
instructions to the committee.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.182" id="par.182">182</a>. </span>This motion stands in the same degree
with the previous question and postponement—and,
if first made, is not superseded by
them—but it takes precedence of a motion to
amend.<!-- TN: period invisible --></p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.183" id="par.183">183</a>. </span>If decided affirmatively, the proposition
is removed from before the assembly;
and, consequently, there is no ground for the
previous question, or for postponement, or
amendment; if negatively, to wit, that the
principal question shall not be committed,
that question may then be suppressed by the
previous question, or postponed, or amended.</p>


<h4 class="sect" title="Amendment">Amendment.</h4>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.184" id="par.184">184</a>. </span>A motion to amend, as has been seen,
may be itself amended. It stands in the
same degree only with the previous question
and indefinite postponement, and neither, if
first moved, is superseded by the other.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.185" id="par.185">185</a>. </span>But this motion is liable to be superseded
by a motion to postpone to a day
<a name="png.098" id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>certain; so that amendment and postponement
competing, the latter is to be first put. The
reason is, that a question for amendment is
not suppressed by postponing or adjourning
the principal question, but remains before
the assembly, whenever the main question is
resumed; for otherwise, it might happen,
that the occasion for other urgent business
might go by and be lost by length of debate
on the amendment, if the assembly had no
power to postpone the whole subject.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.186" id="par.186">186</a>. </span>A motion to amend may also be
superseded by a motion to commit; so that
the latter, though subsequently moved, is to
be first put; because, “in truth, it facilitates
and befriends the motion to amend.”</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.187" id="par.187">187</a>. </span>The effect of both a negative and an
affirmative decision of amendments has already

 /><small>OF THE ORDER OF PROCEEDING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.188" id="par.188">188</a>. </span>When several subjects are before the
assembly; that is, on the table for consideration
(for there can be but a single subject
<em>under</em> consideration at the same time), and
no priority has been given to any one over
another, the presiding officer is not precisely
bound to any order, as to what matters shall
be first taken up; but is left to his own discretion,
unless the assembly on a question
decide to take up a particular subject.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.189" id="par.189">189</a>. </span>A settled order of business, however,
where the proceedings of an assembly are
likely to last a considerable time, and the
matters before it are somewhat numerous, is
useful if not necessary for the government of
the presiding officer, and to restrain individual
members from calling up favorite measures,
or matters under their special charge, out of
their just time. It is also desirable, for
directing the discretion of the assembly, when
<a name="png.100" id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a motion is made to take up a particular
matter to the prejudice of others, which are
of right entitled to be first attended to, in the
general order of business.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.190" id="par.190">190</a>. </span>The order of business may be established
in virtue of some general rule, or by
special orders relating to each particular subject,
and must, of course, necessarily depend
upon the nature and amount of the matters
before the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.191" id="par.191">191</a>. </span>The natural order, in considering and
amending any paper, which consists of several
distinct propositions, is, to begin at the beginning,
and proceed through it by paragraphs;
and this order of proceeding, if strictly adhered
to, as it should always be in numerous
assemblies, would prevent any amendment in
a former part, from being admissible, after a
latter part had been amended; but this rule
does not seem to be so essential to be observed
in smaller bodies, in which it may often be
advantageous to allow of going from one part
of a paper to another, for the purpose of
amendments.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.192" id="par.192">192</a>. </span>To this natural order of beginning at
the beginning, there is one exception according
to parliamentary usage, where a resolution
<a name="png.101" id="png.101" href="#png.101"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>103<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or series of resolutions, or other paper,
has a preamble or title, in which case, the
preamble or title is postponed, until the residue
of the paper is gone through with.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.193" id="par.193">193</a>. </span>In considering a proposition consisting
of several paragraphs, the course is, for
the whole paper to be read entirely through,
in the first place by the clerk; then a second
time, by the presiding officer, by paragraphs;
pausing at the end of each, and putting questions
for amending, if amendments are proposed;
and, when the whole paper has been
gone through with, in this manner, the presiding
officer puts the final question on agreeing
to or adopting the whole paper, as amended
or unamended.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.194" id="par.194">194</a>. </span>When a paper which has been referred
to a committee, and reported back to the
assembly, is taken up for consideration, the
amendments only are first read, in course, by
the clerk. The presiding officer then reads
the first, and puts it to the question, and
so on until the whole are adopted or rejected,
before any other amendment is admitted,
with the exception of an amendment
to an amendment. When the amendments
reported by the committee have been thus
<a name="png.102" id="png.102" href="#png.102"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>104<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>disposed of, the presiding officer pauses, and
gives time for amendments to be proposed in
the assembly to the body of the paper (which
he also does, if the paper has been reported
without amendments, putting no questions
but on amendments proposed); and when
through the whole, he puts the question on
agreeing to or adopting the paper, as the resolution,
order, etc., of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.195" id="par.195">195</a>. </span>The final question is sometimes stated
merely on the acceptance of the report, but a
better form is on agreeing with the committee
in the resolution, order, or whatever else
the conclusion of the report may be, as amended,
or without amendment, and the resolution
or order is then to be entered in the journal
as the resolution, etc., of the assembly, and
not as the report of the committee accepted.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.196" id="par.196">196</a>. </span>When the paper referred to a committee
is reported back, as amended, in a new
draft (which may be and often is done, where
the amendments are numerous and comparatively
unimportant), the new draft is to be
considered, as an amendment, and is to be
first amended, if necessary, and then put to
the question as an amendment reported by
the committee; or, the course may be, first to
<a name="png.103" id="png.103" href="#png.103"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>105<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>accept the new draft, as a substitute for the
original paper, and then to treat it as such.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.197" id="par.197">197</a>. </span>It often happens, that, besides a principal
question, there are several others connected
with it, pending at the same time,
which are to be taken in their order; as, for
example, suppose, <i>first</i>, a principal motion;
<i>second</i>, a motion to amend; <i>third</i>, a motion
to commit; <i>fourth</i>, the preceding motions
being pending, a question of order arises in
the debate, which gives occasion, <i>fifth</i>, to a
question of privilege, and this leads, <i>sixth</i>,
to a subsidiary motion, as, to lie on the table.
The regular course of proceeding requires the
motion to lie on the table to be first put; if
this is negatived, the question of privilege is
then settled; after that comes the question of
order; then the question of commitment; if
that is<!-- TN: original reads "tha tis" --> negatived, the question<!-- TN: original reads "questson" --> of amendment
is taken; and, lastly, the main question.
This example will sufficiently illustrate the
manner in which questions may grow out of
one another, and in what order they are to be
decided.<a name="fn24" id="fn24"></a><a title="Go to footnote 24"

 /></span></span></a><a name="par.198" id="par.198">198</a>. </span>When a motion is made and seconded,
it is the duty of the presiding officer to propose
it to the assembly; until this is done,
it is not a question before the assembly, to be
acted upon or considered in any manner; and
consequently it is not then in order for any
member to rise either to debate it, or to make
any motion in relation to it whatever.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.199" id="par.199">199</a>. </span>It is therefore a most unparliamentary
and abusive proceeding to allow a principal
motion and a subsidiary one relating to it to
be proposed and stated together, and to be
put to the question in their order; as is done,
when a member moves a principal question,
a resolution, for example, and, at the same
time, the previous question, or that the resolution
lie on the table. In such a case, the
presiding officer should take no notice whatever
of the subsidiary motion, but should
propose the principal one by itself in the
usual manner, before allowing any other to be
made. Other members, then, would not be
deprived of their rights of debate, etc., in relation
to the subject moved.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.200" id="par.200">200</a>. </span>When a member has obtained the
floor, he cannot be cut off from addressing
the assembly, on the question before it; nor,
<a name="png.105" id="png.105" href="#png.105"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>when speaking, can he be interrupted in his
speech, by any other member rising and moving
an adjournment, or for the orders of the day,
or by making any other privileged motion of
the same kind; it being a general rule, that a
member in possession of the floor, or proceeding
with his speech, cannot be taken down or
interrupted, but by a call to order; and the
question of order being decided, he is still to
be heard through. A call for an adjournment,
or for the orders of the day, or for the
question, by gentlemen in their seats, is not
a motion; as no motion can be made, without
rising and addressing the chair, and being
called to by the presiding officer. Such calls
for the question are themselves breaches of
order, which, though the member who has
risen may respect them, as an expression of
the impatience of the assembly at further debate,
do not prevent him from going on if he
pleases.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.201" id="par.201">201</a>. </span>Debate in a deliberative assembly
must be distinguished from forensic debate,
or that which takes place before a judicial
tribunal; the former being, in theory, at least,
more the expression of individual opinions
among the members of the same body; the
latter more a contest for victory, between the
disputants, before a distinct and independent
body; the former not admitting of replies;
the latter regarding reply as the right of one
of the parties.<a name="fn25" id="fn25"></a><a title="Go to footnote 25"

 </span></a></p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.202" id="par.202">202</a>. </span>It is a general rule, in all deliberative
assemblies, that the presiding officer shall not
participate in the debate, or other proceedings,
in any other capacity than as such officer.
<a name="png.107" id="png.107" href="#png.107"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>He is only allowed, therefore, to state matters
of fact within his knowledge; to inform the
assembly on points of order or the course of
proceeding, when called upon for that purpose,
or when he finds it necessary to do so;
and on appeals from his decision on questions
of order, to address the assembly in debate.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section I. As to the Manner of Speaking">Sect. I. As to the Manner of Speaking.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.203" id="par.203">203</a>. </span>When a member desires to address
the assembly, on any subject before it (as
well as to make a motion), he is to rise and
stand up in his place, uncovered, and to
address himself not to the assembly, or any
particular member, but to the presiding officer,
who, on hearing him, calls to him by his name,
that the assembly may take notice who it is
that speaks, and give their attention accordingly.
If any question arises, as to who shall
be entitled to the floor, where several members
rise at or nearly at the same time, it is
decided in the manner already described (<a href="#par.47">47</a><!-- TN: original reads "46" -->),
as to obtaining the floor to make a motion.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.204" id="par.204">204</a>. </span>It is customary, indeed, for the presiding
officer, after a motion has been made,
seconded, and proposed, to give the floor to
<a name="png.108" id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the mover,<a name="fn26" id="fn26"></a><a title="Go to footnote 26"
 href="#Footnote26" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> in preference to others, if he rises
to speak; or, on resuming a debate, after an
adjournment, to give the floor, if he desires
it, to the mover of the adjournment, in preference
to other members; or, where two or more
members claim the floor, to prefer him who is
opposed to the measure in question; but, in
all these cases, the determination of the presiding
officer may be overruled by the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.205" id="par.205">205</a>. </span>It is sometimes thought, that, when a
member, in the course of debate, breaks off
his speech, and gives up the floor to another
for a particular purpose, he is entitled to it
again, as of right, when that purpose is accomplished;
but, though this is generally
conceded, yet, when a member gives up the
floor for one purpose, he does so for all; and
it is not possible for the presiding officer to
take notice of and enforce agreements of this
nature between members.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.206" id="par.206">206</a>. </span>No person, in speaking, is to mention
<a name="png.109" id="png.109" href="#png.109"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>111<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a member then present by his name; but to
describe him by his seat in the assembly, or
as the member who spoke last, or last but
one, or on the other side of the question, or
by some other equivalent expression. The
purpose of this rule is to guard as much as
possible against the excitement of all personal
feeling, either of favor or of hostility, by
separating, as it were, the official from the
personal character of each member, and having
regard to the former only in the debate.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.207" id="par.207">207</a>. </span>If the presiding officer rises up to
speak, any other member, who may have
risen for the same purpose, ought to sit down,
in order that the former may be first heard;
but this rule does not authorize the presiding
officer to interrupt a member, whilst speaking,
or to cut off one to whom he has given
the floor; he must wait like other members
until such member has done speaking.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.208" id="par.208">208</a>. </span>A member, whilst speaking, must remain
standing in his place, uncovered; and,
when he has finished his speech, he ought to
resume his seat; but if unable to stand without
pain or inconvenience, in consequence of
age, sickness, or other infirmity, he may be
indulged to speak sitting.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section II. As to the Matter in Speaking"><a name="png.110" id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>112<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Sect. II. As to the Matter in
Speaking.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.209" id="par.209">209</a>. </span>Every question, that can be made in
a deliberative assembly, is susceptible of being
debated,<a name="fn27" id="fn27"></a><a title="Go to footnote 27"
 href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> according to its nature; that is,
every member has the right of expressing his
opinion upon it. Hence, it is a general rule,
and the principal one relating to this matter,
that, in debate, those who speak are to confine
themselves to the question, and not to
speak impertinently, or beside the subject.
So long as a member has the floor, and keeps
within the rule, he may speak for as long a
time as he pleases; though, if an uninteresting
speaker trespasses too much upon the
time and patience of the assembly, the members
seldom fail to show their dissatisfaction
in some way or other, which induces him to
bring his remarks to a close.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.210" id="par.210">210</a>. </span>It is also a rule, that no person, in
speaking, is to use indecent language against
the proceedings of the assembly, or to reflect
<a name="png.111" id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>113<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>upon any of its prior determinations, unless
he means to conclude his remarks with a motion
to rescind such determination; but while
a proposition under consideration is still
pending, and not adopted, though it may
have been reported by a committee, reflections
on it are no reflections on the assembly.
The rule applies equally to the proceedings of
committees; which are, indeed, the proceedings
of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.211" id="par.211">211</a>. </span>Another rule in speaking is, that no
member is at liberty to digress from the matter
of the question, to fall upon the person of
another, and to speak reviling, nipping, or
unmannerly words of or to him. The nature
or consequences of a measure may be reprobated
in strong terms; but to arraign the
motives of those who advocate it, is a personality
and against order.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.212" id="par.212">212</a>. </span>It is very often an extremely difficult
and delicate matter to decide whether the
remarks of a member are pertinent or relevant
to the question; but it will, in general, be
safe for the presiding officer to consider them
so, unless they very clearly reflect, in an improper
manner, either upon the person or
motives of a member, or upon the proceedings
<a name="png.112" id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>114<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the assembly; or the member speaking
digresses from or manifestly mistakes the
question.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.213" id="par.213">213</a>. </span>It often happens in the consideration
of a subject, that, whilst the general question
remains the same, the particular question
before the assembly is constantly changing;
thus, while, for example, the general question
is on the adoption of a series of resolutions,
the particular question may, at one moment,
be on an amendment; at another on postponement;
and, again, on the previous question.
In all these cases, the particular
question supersedes, for the time, the main
question; and those who speak to it must
confine their remarks accordingly. The enforcement
of order, in this respect, requires
the closest attention on the part of the presiding
officer.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.214" id="par.214">214</a>. </span>When a member is interrupted by
the presiding officer, or called to order by a
member,<a name="fn28" id="fn28"></a><a title="Go to footnote 28"
 href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>28<span class="ns">]

<a name="png.113" id="png.113" href="#png.113"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the question, a question may be made as to
whether he shall be allowed to proceed in his
remarks, in the manner he was speaking
when he was interrupted; but, if no question
is made, or if one is made and decided in the
negative, he is still to be allowed to proceed
in order, that is, abandoning the objectionable
course of remark.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section III. As to Times of speaking">Sect. III. As to Times of speaking.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.215" id="par.215">215</a>. </span>The general rule, in all deliberative
assemblies, unless it is otherwise specially
provided, is, that no member shall speak
more than once to the same question;<a name="fn29" id="fn29"></a><a title="Go to footnote 29"
 href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> although
the debate on that question may be
adjourned and continued through several
days; and, although a member, who desires
to speak a second time, has, in the course of
the debate, changed his opinion.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.216" id="par.216">216</a>. </span>This rule refers to the same question,
<a name="png.114" id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>technically considered; for, if a resolution is
moved and debated, and then referred to a
committee, those who speak on the introduction
of the motion may speak again on the
question presented by the report of the committee,
though it is substantially the same
question with the former; and, so, members,
who have spoken on the principal or main
question, may speak again on all the subsidiary
or incidental questions arising in the
course of the debate.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.217" id="par.217">217</a>. </span>The rule, as to speaking but once on
a question, if strictly enforced, will prevent a
member from speaking a second time without
the general consent of the assembly, so long
as there is any other member who himself
desires to speak; but, when all who desire to
speak have spoken, a member may speak a
second time by leave of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.218" id="par.218">218</a>. </span>A member may also be permitted to
speak a second time, in the same debate, in
order to clear a matter of fact; or merely to
explain himself in some material part of his
speech; or to the orders of the assembly, if
they be transgressed (although no question
may be made), but carefully keeping within
that line and not falling into the matter itself.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.115" id="png.115" href="#png.115"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>117<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.219" id="par.219">219</a>. </span>It is sometimes supposed, that, because
a member has a right to explain himself,
he therefore has a right to interrupt another
member whilst speaking, in order to
make the explanation: but this is a mistake;
he should wait until the member speaking
has finished; and if a member, on being requested,
yields the floor for an explanation,
he relinquishes it altogether.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.220" id="par.220">220</a>. </span>The only mode in use, in this country,
until recently, for the purpose of putting an
end to an unprofitable or tiresome debate,
was by moving the previous question; the
effect of which motion, as already explained,
if decided in the affirmative, is to require the
main or principal question to be immediately
taken. When this question is moved, therefore,
it necessarily suspends all further consideration
of the main question, and precludes
all further debate or amendment of it;
though, as has been seen, it stands in the
same degree with postponement, amendment,
and commitment; and, unless in virtue of a
special rule, cannot be moved while either of
those motions is pending.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.116" id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>118<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.221" id="par.221">221</a>. </span>The other mode of putting an end to
debate, which has recently been introduced
into use, is for the assembly to adopt beforehand
a special order in reference to a particular
subject, that, at such a time specified,
all debate upon it shall cease, and all motions
or questions pending in relation to it
shall be decided.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.222" id="par.222">222</a>. </span>Another rule, which has lately been
introduced for the purpose of shortening
rather than stopping debate, is, that no member
shall be permitted to speak more than a
certain specified time on any question; so
that, when the time allotted has expired, the
presiding officer announces the fact, and the
member speaking resumes his seat.<a name="fn30" id="fn30"></a><a title="Go to footnote 30"

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.223" id="par.223">223</a>. </span>Every member having the right to be
heard, every other member is bound to conduct
himself in such a manner, that this right
may be effectual. Hence, it is a rule of order,
as well as of decency, that no member is to
disturb another in his speech by hissing,
coughing, spitting; by speaking, or whispering;
by passing between the presiding officer
and the member speaking; by going across
the assembly-room, or walking up and down
in it; or by any other disorderly deportment,
which tends to disturb or disconcert a member
who is speaking.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.224" id="par.224">224</a>. </span>But, if a member speaking finds, that
he is not regarded with that respectful attention,
which his equal right demands,—that
it is not the inclination of the assembly to
hear him,—and that by conversation or any
other noise they endeavor to drown his voice,—it
is his most prudent course to submit
himself to the pleasure of the assembly, and
to sit down; for it scarcely ever happens,
that the members of the assembly are guilty
of this piece of ill-manners, without some excuse
or provocation, or that they are so
<a name="png.118" id="png.118" href="#png.118"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wholly inattentive to one, who says anything
worth their hearing.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.225" id="par.225">225</a>. </span>It is the duty of the presiding officer,
in such a case, to endeavor to reduce the
assembly to order and decorum; but, if his
repeated calls to order, and his appeals to the
good sense and decency of the members,
prove ineffectual, it then becomes his duty to
call by name any member who obstinately
persists in irregularity; whereupon the assembly
may require such member to withdraw;
who is then to be heard, if he desires
it, in exculpation, and to withdraw; then the
presiding officer states the offence committed,
and the assembly considers of the kind and
degree of punishment to be inflicted.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.226" id="par.226">226</a>. </span>If, on repeated trials, the presiding
officer finds that the assembly will not support
him in the exercise of his authority, he
will then be justified, but not till then, in
permitting, without censure, every kind of

of language, which is personally offensive to
another, or insulting to the assembly, and the

to complain of it to the assembly, the course
of proceedings is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.228" id="par.228">228</a>. </span>The member speaking is immediately
interrupted in the course of his speech, by
another or several members rising and calling
to order; and, the member, who objects or
complains of the words, is then called upon
by the presiding officer to state the words
which he complains of, repeating them exactly
as he conceives them to have been spoken,
in order that they may be reduced to writing
by the clerk; or the member complaining,
without being so called upon, may proceed at
once to state the words either verbally or in
writing, and desire that the clerk may take
them down at the table. The presiding
officer may then direct the clerk to take them
down; but if he sees the objection to be a
trivial one, and thinks there is no foundation
for their being thought disorderly, he will
prudently delay giving any such directions, in
order not unnecessarily to interrupt the proceedings;
though if the members generally
seem to be in favor of having the words taken
down, by calling out to that effect, or by a
vote, which the assembly may doubtless pass,
<a name="png.120" id="png.120" href="#png.120"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>122<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the presiding officer should certainly order the
clerk to take them down, in the form and
manner in which they are stated by the member
who objects.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.229" id="par.229">229</a>. </span>The words objected to being thus
written down, and forming a part of the
minutes in the clerk’s book, they are next to
be read to the member who was speaking,
who may deny that those are the words
which he spoke, in which case, the assembly
must decide by a question, whether they are
the words or not.<a name="fn31" id="fn31"></a><a title="Go to footnote 31"
 href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor"><span

 </span></a> If he does not deny that
he spoke those words, or when the assembly
has itself determined what the words are,
then the<!-- TN: original reads "they"  --> member may either justify them,
or explain the sense in which he used them,
so as to remove the objection of their being
disorderly; or he may make an apology for
them.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.230" id="par.230">230</a>. </span>If the justification, or explanation, or
apology, of the member, is thought sufficient
by the assembly, no further proceeding is
necessary; the member may resume and go
on with his speech, the assembly being

 class="ns">[p</span>123<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>presumed, unless some further motion is made,
to be satisfied; but if any two members (one
to make and the other to second the motion)
think it necessary to state a question, so as
to take the sense of the assembly upon the
words, and whether the member in using
them has been guilty of any offence towards
the assembly, the member must withdraw
before that question is stated; and then the
sense of the assembly must be taken, and
such further proceedings had in relation to
punishing the member, as may be thought
necessary and proper.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.231" id="par.231">231</a>. </span>The above is the course of proceeding
established by the writers of greatest authority,<a name="fn32" id="fn32"></a><a title="Go to footnote 32"
 href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></a>
and ought invariably to be pursued; it
might however be improved, by the member
who objects to words writing them down at
once, and thereupon moving that they be
made a part of the minutes; by which means,
the presiding officer would be relieved from
the responsibility of determining, in the first
instance, upon the character of the words.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.232" id="par.232">232</a>. </span>If offensive words are not taken notice

 </span></a> but the
member is allowed to finish his speech, and
then any other person speaks, or any other
matter of business intervenes, before notice is
taken of the words which gave offence, the
words are not to be written down, or the
member using them censured. This rule is
established for the common security of all the
members; and to prevent the mistakes which
must necessarily happen, if words complained
of are not immediately reduced to writing.</p>

<h2 class="runon" title="Chapter XIII. Of the Question">CHAPTER XIII.<br
 /><small>OF THE QUESTION.</small></h2>


<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.233" id="par.233">233</a>. </span>When any proposition is made to a
deliberative assembly, it is called a <em>motion</em>;
when it is stated or propounded to the assembly,
for their acceptance or rejection, it
is denominated a <em>question</em>; and, when
<a name="png.123" id="png.123" href="#png.123"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>adopted, it becomes the <em>order</em>, <em>resolution</em>, or
<em>vote</em>, of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.234" id="par.234">234</a>. </span>All the proceedings, which have thus
far been considered, have only had for their
object to bring a proposition into a form to
be put to the question; that is, to be adopted
as the sense, will, or judgment, of the assembly,
or to be rejected; according as such
proposition may be found to unite in its
favor, or to fail of uniting a majority of the
members.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.235" id="par.235">235</a>. </span>When any proposition, whether principal,
subsidiary, or incidental, or of whatever
nature it may be, is made, seconded, and
stated, if no alteration is proposed,—or if it
admits of none, or if it is amended,—and the
debate upon it, if any, appears to be brought
to a close, the presiding officer then inquires,
whether the assembly is ready for the question?
and, if no person rises, the question is
then stated, and the votes of the assembly
taken upon it.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.236" id="par.236">236</a>. </span>The question is not always stated to
the assembly, in the precise form in which it
arises or is introduced; thus, for example,
when a member presents a petition, or the
chairman of a committee offers a report, the
<a name="png.124" id="png.124" href="#png.124"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>question which arises, if no motion is made,
is, <em>Shall the petition or the report be received?</em>
and, so, when the previous question is moved,
it is stated in this form, <em>Shall the main question
be now put?</em>—the question being stated,
in all cases, in the form in which it will
appear on the journal, if it passes in the
affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.237" id="par.237">237</a>. </span>In matters of trifling importance, or
which are generally of course, such as receiving
petitions and reports, withdrawing
motions, reading papers, etc., the presiding
officer most commonly supposes or takes for
granted the consent of the assembly, where
no objection is expressed, and does not go
through the formality of taking the question
by a vote. But if, after a vote has been taken
in this informal way and declared, any member
rises to object, the presiding officer should
consider every thing that has passed as nothing,
and, at once, go back and pursue the
regular course of proceeding. Thus, if a
petition is received, without a question, and
the clerk is proceeding to read it, in the
usual order of business, if any one rises to
object, it will be the safest and most proper
course, for the presiding officer to require a
<a name="png.125" id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>127<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>motion for receiving it to be regularly made
and seconded.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.238" id="par.238">238</a>. </span>The question being stated by the presiding
officer, he first puts it in the affirmative,
namely: <em>As many as are of opinion
that</em>—repeating the words of the question,—<em>say
aye</em>; and, immediately, all the members
who are of that opinion answer <em>aye</em>; the presiding
officer then puts the question negatively:
<em>As many as are of a different opinion
say no</em>; and, thereupon, all the members
who are of that opinion answer <em>no</em>. The presiding
officer judges by his ear which side
has “the more voices,” and decides accordingly,
that <em>the ayes have it</em>, or <em>the noes have
it</em>, as the case may be. If the presiding
officer is doubtful as to the majority of
voices, he may put the question a second
time, and if he is still unable to decide, or,
if, having decided according to his judgment,
any member rises and declares that he believes
the <em>ayes</em> or the <em>noes</em> (whichever it may
be) <em>have it</em>, contrary to the declaration of the
presiding officer,<a name="fn34" id="fn34"></a><a title="Go to footnote 34"
 href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> then the presiding officer
directs the assembly to divide, in order that
<a name="png.126" id="png.126" href="#png.126"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>128<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the members on the one side and the other
may be counted.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.239" id="par.239">239</a>. </span>If, however, any new motion should
be made, after the presiding officer’s declaration,
or, if a member, who was not in the
assembly-room when the question was taken,
should come in, it will then be too late to
contradict the presiding officer, and have the
assembly divided.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.240" id="par.240">240</a>. </span>The above is the parliamentary form
of taking a question, and is in general use in
this country; but, in some of our legislative
assemblies, and especially in those of the
New England states, the suffrages are given
by the members holding up their right hands,
first those in the affirmative, and then those
in the negative, of the question. If the presiding
officer cannot determine, by the show
of hands, which side has the majority, he
may call upon the members to vote again,
and if he is still in doubt, or if his declaration
is questioned, a division takes place.
When the question is taken in this manner,
the presiding officer directs the members, first
on the affirmative side, and then on the negative,
to manifest their opinion by holding
up the right hand.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.127" id="png.127" href="#png.127"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>129<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.241" id="par.241">241</a>. </span>When a division of the assembly takes
place, the presiding officer sometimes directs
the members to range themselves on different
sides of the assembly-room, and either counts
them himself, or they are counted by tellers
appointed by him for the purpose, or by monitors
permanently appointed for that and other
purposes; or the members rise in their seats,
first on the affirmative and then on the negative,
and (standing uncovered) are counted in
the same manner. When the members are
counted by the presiding officer, he announces
the numbers and declares the result. When
they are counted by tellers or monitors, the
tellers must first agree among themselves, and
then the one who has told for the majority
reports the numbers to the presiding officer,
who, thereupon, declares the result.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.242" id="par.242">242</a>. </span>The best mode of dividing an assembly,
that is at all numerous, is for the presiding
officer to appoint tellers for each division
or section of the assembly-room, and then to
require the members, first those in the affirmative,
and then those in the negative, to rise,
stand uncovered, and be counted; this being
done, on each side, the tellers of the several
<a name="png.128" id="png.128" href="#png.128"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>130<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>divisions make their returns, and the presiding
officer declares the result.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.243" id="par.243">243</a>. </span>If the members are equally divided,
the presiding officer may, if he pleases, give
the casting vote; or, if he chooses, he may refrain
from voting, in which case, the motion
does not prevail, and the decision is in the
negative.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.244" id="par.244">244</a>. </span>It is a general rule, that every member,
who is in the assembly-room at the time
when the question is stated, has not only the
right but is bound to vote; and, on the other
hand, that no member can vote, who was not
in the room at that time.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.245" id="par.245">245</a>. </span>The only other form of taking the
question, which requires to be described, is
one in general use in this country, by means
of which the names of the members voting on
the one side and on the other are ascertained
and entered in the journal of the assembly.
This mode, which is peculiar to the legislative
bodies of the United States, is called taking
the questions by yeas and nays.  In order to
take a question in this manner, it is stated on
both sides at once, namely: <em>As many as are
or opinion, that, etc., will when their names
are called, answer yes</em>; and <em>As many as are
<a name="png.129" id="png.129" href="#png.129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>131<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of a different opinion will, when their names
are called, answer no</em>; the roll of the assembly
is then called over by the clerk, and each
member, as his name is called, rises in his
place, and answers <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>, and the clerk
notes the answer as the roll is called. When
the roll has been gone through the clerk reads
over first the names of those who have answered
in the affirmative and then the names
of those who have answered in the negative,
in order that if he has made any mistake in
noting the answer, or if any member has made
a mistake in his answer, the mistake of
either may be corrected. The names having
been thus read over, and the mistakes, if any,
corrected, the clerk counts the numbers on
each side, and reports them to the presiding
officer, who declares the result to the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.246" id="par.246">246</a>. </span>The following is the mode practised
in the house of representatives of Massachusetts,
(which is by far the most numerous of
all the legislative bodies in this country,) of
taking a question by yeas and nays. The
names of the members being printed on a
sheet, the clerk calls them in their order; and
as each one answers, the clerk (responding to
<a name="png.130" id="png.130" href="#png.130"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>132<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the member, at the same time) places a figure
in pencil, expressing the number of the answer,
at the left or right of the name, according
as the answer is yes or no; so that the
last figure or number, on each side, shows the
number of the answers on that side; and the
two last numbers or figures represent the respective
numbers of the affirmatives and negatives
on the division. Thus, at the left hand
of the name of the member who first answers
<em>yes</em>, the clerk places a figure 1; at the right
hand of the first member who answers <em>no</em>, he
also places a figure 1; the second member that
answers <em>yes</em> is marked 2; and so on to the
end of the list; the side of the name, on which
the figure is placed, denoting whether the
answer is <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>, and the figure denoting
the number of the answer on that side. The
affirmatives and negatives are then read separately,
if necessary, though this is usually
omitted, and the clerk is then prepared, by
means of the last figure on each side, to give
the numbers to the speaker to be announced
to the house. The names and answers are
afterwards recorded on the journal.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.247" id="par.247">247</a>. </span>In any of the modes of taking a question,
in which it is first put on one side, and
<a name="png.131" id="png.131" href="#png.131"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>133<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>then on the other, it is no full question, until
the negative as well as the affirmative has
been put. Consequently, until the negative
has been put, it is in order for any member,
in the same manner as if the division had not
commenced, to rise and speak, make motions
for amendment, or otherwise, and thus renew
the debate; and this, whether such member
was in the assembly-room or not, when the
question was put and partly taken. In such
a case, the question must be put over again on
the affirmative as well as the negative side;
for the reason, that members who were not in
the assembly-room, when the question was
first put, may have since come in, and also
that some of those who voted, may have since
changed their minds. When a question is
taken by yeas and nays, and the negative as
well as the affirmative of the question is
stated, and the voting on each side begins
and proceeds at the same time, the question
cannot be opened and the debate renewed,
after the voting has commenced.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.248" id="par.248">248</a>. </span>If any question arises, in a point of
order, as, for example, as to the right or the
duty of a member to vote, during a division,
the presiding officer must decide it peremptorily,
<a name="png.132" id="png.132" href="#png.132"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>134<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>subject to the revision and correction of
the assembly, after the division is over. In a
case of this kind, there can be no debate,
though the presiding officer may if he pleases
receive the assistance of members with their
advice, which they are to give sitting, in order
to avoid even the appearance of a debate;
but this can only be with the leave of the
presiding officer, as otherwise the division
might be prolonged to an inconvenient length;
nor can any question be taken, for otherwise
there might be division upon division without
end.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.249" id="par.249">249</a>. </span>When, from counting the assembly on
a division, it appears that there is not a quorum
present, there is no decision; but the
matter in question continues in the same state,
in which it was before the division; and, when
afterwards resumed, whether on the same or
on some future day, it must be taken up at
that precise point.</p>

 /><small>OF RECONSIDERATION.</small></h2>


<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.250" id="par.250">250<!-- TN: original reads "256" --></a>. </span>It is a principle of parliamentary law,
upon which many of the rules and proceedings
previously stated are founded, that when a
question has once been put to a deliberative
assembly, and decided, whether in the affirmative
or negative, that decision is the judgment
of the assembly, and cannot be again
brought into question.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.251" id="par.251">251<!-- original reads "252" --></a>. </span>This principle holds equally, although
the question proposed is not the identical
question which has already been decided, but
only its equivalent; as, for example, where
the negative of one question amounts to the
affirmative of the other, and leaves no other
alternative, these questions are the equivalents
of one another, and a decision of the one
necessarily concludes the other.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.252" id="par.252">252</a>. </span>A common application of the rule as
to equivalent questions occurs in the case
of an amendment proposed by striking out
words; in which it is the invariable practice
<a name="png.134" id="png.134" href="#png.134"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to consider the negative of striking out as
equivalent to the affirmative of agreeing; so
that to put a question on agreeing, after a
question on striking out its negatived, would
be, in effect, to put the same question twice
over.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.253" id="par.253">253</a>. </span>The principle above stated does not
apply so as to prevent putting the same question
in the different stages of any proceeding;
as, for example, in legislative bodies, the
different stages of a bill; so, in considering
reports of committees, questions already taken
and decided, before the subject was referred,
may be again proposed; and, in like manner,
orders of the assembly, and instructions or
references to committees, may be discharged
or rescinded.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.254" id="par.254">254</a>. </span>The inconvenience of this rule, which
is still maintained in all its strictness in the
British parliament (though divers expedients
are there resorted to to counteract or evade it),<a name="fn35" id="fn35"></a><a title="Go to footnote 35"
 href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></a>
<a name="png.135" id="png.135" href="#png.135"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>has led to the introduction into the parliamentary
practice of this country of the motion
for <em>reconsideration</em>; which, while it recognizes
and upholds the rule in all its ancient
strictness, yet allows a deliberative assembly,
for sufficient reasons, to relieve itself from
the embarrassment and inconvenience, which
would occasionally result from a strict enforcement
of the rule in a particular case.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.255" id="par.255">255</a>. </span>It has now come to be a common
practice in all our deliberative assemblies,
and may consequently be considered as a
principle of the common parliamentary law
of this country, to reconsider a vote already
passed, whether affirmatively or negatively.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.256" id="par.256">256</a>. </span>For this purpose, a motion is made
and seconded, in the usual manner, that such
a vote be reconsidered; and, if this motion
prevails, the matter stands before the assembly
in precisely the same state and condition,
and the same questions are to be put in relation
to it, as if the vote reconsidered had
never been passed. Thus, if an amendment
by inserting words is moved and rejected,
the same amendment cannot be moved
again; but, the assembly may reconsider the
vote by which it was rejected, and then the
<a name="png.136" id="png.136" href="#png.136"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>138<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>question will recur on the amendment, precisely
as if the former vote had never been
passed.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.257" id="par.257">257</a>. </span>It is usual in legislative bodies, to
regulate by a special rule the time, manner,
and by whom, a motion to reconsider may be
made; thus, for example, that it shall be made
only on the same or a succeeding day,—by a
member who voted with the majority,—or
at a time when there are as many members
present as there were when the vote was
passed; but, where there is no special rule on
the subject, a motion to reconsider must be
considered in the same light as any other
motion, and as subject to no other rules.</p>

principle that when a subject has been once decided,
either in the affirmative or negative, it is to remain

remedy the inconveniences that sometimes occur, it
resorts to various expedients; as, by passing an explanatory
act, or an act to rectify mistakes in an act,

<h3 class="sect" title="Section I. Their Nature and Functions">Sect. I. Their Nature and Functions.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.258" id="par.258">258</a>. </span>It is usual in all deliberative assemblies,
to take the preliminary (sometimes,
also, the intermediate) measures, and to prepare
matters to be acted upon, in the assembly,
<a name="png.137" id="png.137" href="#png.137"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>139<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by means of committees, composed either
of members specially selected for the particular
occasion, or appointed beforehand for all
matters of the same nature.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.259" id="par.259">259</a>. </span>Committees of the first kind are usually
called <em>select</em>, the others <em>standing</em>; though
the former appellation belongs with equal
propriety to both, in order to distinguish
them from another form of committee, constituted
either for a particular occasion, or
for all cases of a certain kind, which is composed
of all the members of the assembly,
and therefore denominated a <em>committee of the
whole</em>.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.260" id="par.260">260</a>. </span>The advantages of proceeding in this
mode are manifold. It enables a deliberative
assembly to do many things, which, from its
numbers, it would be otherwise be unable to
do;—to accomplish a much greater quantity
of business, by dividing it among the members,
than could possibly be accomplished, if
the whole body were obliged to devote itself
to each particular subject;—and to act in the
preliminary and preparatory steps, with a
greater degree of freedom, than is compatible
with the forms of proceeding usually
observed in full assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.138" id="png.138" href="#png.138"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>140<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.261" id="par.261">261</a>. </span>Committees are appointed to consider
a particular subject, either at large or under
special instructions: to obtain information in
reference to a matter before the assembly,
either by personal inquiry and inspection, or
by the examination of witnesses; and to
digest and put into the proper form, for the
adoption of the assembly, all resolutions,
votes, orders, and other papers, with which
they may be charged. Committees are commonly
said to be the “eyes and ears” of the
assembly; it is equally true, that, for certain
purposes, they are also its “head and hands.”</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.262" id="par.262">262</a>. </span>The powers and functions of committees
depend chiefly upon the general authority
and particular instructions given them by the
assembly, at the time of their appointment;
but they may also be, and very often are,
further instructed, whilst they are in the
exercise of their functions; and, sometimes,
it even happens, that these additional instructions
wholly change the nature of a
committee, by charging it with inquiries
quite different from those for which it was
originally established.</p>

<h3 class="sect" title="Section II. Their Appointment"><a name="png.139" id="png.139" href="#png.139"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>141<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>Sect. II. Their Appointment.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.263" id="par.263">263</a>. </span>In the manner of appointing committees,
there is no difference between standing
and other select committees, as to the mode
of selecting the members to compose them;
and, in reference to committees of the whole,
as there is no selection of members, they are
appointed simply by the order of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.264" id="par.264">264</a>. </span>In the appointment of select committees,
the first thing to be done is to fix upon
the number. This is usually effected in the
same manner that blanks are filled, namely,
by members proposing, without the formality
of a motion, such members as they please,
which are then separately put to the question,
beginning with the largest and going
regularly through to the smallest, until the
assembly comes to a vote.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.265" id="par.265">265</a>. </span>The number being settled, there are
three modes of selecting the members, to wit,
by the appointment of the presiding officer,—by
ballot,—and by nomination and vote of
the assembly; the first, sometimes in virtue
of a standing rule, sometimes in pursuance
of a vote of the assembly in a particular case;
<a name="png.140" id="png.140" href="#png.140"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>142<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the second always in pursuance of a vote; the
last is the usual course where no vote is taken.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.266" id="par.266">266</a>. </span>In deliberative assemblies, whose sittings
are of considerable length, as legislative
bodies, it is usual to provide by a standing
rule, that, unless otherwise ordered in a
particular case, all committees shall be named
by the presiding officer. Where this is the
case, whenever a committee is ordered, and
the number settled, the presiding officer at
once names the members to compose it.
Sometimes, also, the rule fixes the number,
of which, unless otherwise ordered, committees
shall consist. This mode of appointing
a committee is frequently resorted to, where
there is no rule on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.267" id="par.267">267</a>. </span>When a committee is ordered to be
appointed by ballot, the members are chosen
by the assembly, either singly or altogether,
as may be ordered, in the same manner that
other elections are made; and, in such elections,
as in other cases of the election of the
officers of the assembly, a majority of all the
votes given in is necessary to a choice.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.268" id="par.268">268</a>. </span>When a committee is directed to be appointed
by nomination and vote, the names
of the members proposed are put to the question
<a name="png.141" id="png.141" href="#png.141"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>143<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>singly, and approved or rejected by the
assembly, by a vote taken in the usual manner.
If the nomination is directed to be
made by the presiding officer, he may propose
the names in the same manner, or all at
once; the former mode being the most direct
and simple; the latter enabling the assembly
to vote more understandingly upon the
several names proposed. When the nomination
is directed to be made at large, the
presiding officer calls upon the assembly to
nominate, and names being mentioned accordingly,
he puts to vote the first name he
hears.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.269" id="par.269">269</a>. </span>It is also a compendious mode of appointing
a committee, to revive one which
has already discharged itself by a report; or
by charging a committee appointed for one
purpose with some additional duty, of the
same or a different character.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.270" id="par.270">270</a>. </span>In regard to the appointment of committees,
so far as the selection of the members
is concerned, it is a general rule in legislative
bodies, when a bill is to be referred, that none
who speak directly against the body of it are
to be of the committee, for the reason, that he
who would totally destroy will not amend;
<a name="png.142" id="png.142" href="#png.142"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>144<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>but that, for the opposite reason, those who
only take exceptions to some particulars in
the bill are to be of the committee. This rule
supposes the purpose of the commitment to
be, not the consideration of the general merits
of the bill, but the amendment of it in its
particular provisions, so as to make it acceptable
to the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.271" id="par.271">271</a>. </span>This rule, of course, is only for the
guidance of the presiding officer, and the
members, in the exercise of their discretion;
as the assembly may refuse to excuse from
serving, or may itself appoint, on a committee,
persons who are opposed to the subject
referred. It is customary, however, in all
deliberative assemblies, to constitute a committee
of such persons (the mover and
seconder of a measure being of course appointed),
a majority of whom, at least, are
favorably inclined to the measure proposed.<a name="fn36" id="fn36"></a><a title="Go to footnote 36"
 href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.272" id="par.272">272</a>. </span>When a committee has been appointed,
<a name="png.143" id="png.143" href="#png.143"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>145<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>in reference to a particular subject, it is the
duty of the secretary of the assembly to make
out a list of the members, together with a
certified copy of the authority or instructions
under which they are to act, and to
give the papers to the member first named on
the list of the committee, if convenient, but,
otherwise, to any other member of the committee.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section III. Their Organization and Manner of Proceeding">Sect. III. Their Organization and
Manner of Proceeding.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.273" id="par.273">273</a>. </span>The person first named on a committee<!-- TN: original reads "commit-
mittee" -->
acts as its chairman, or presiding
officer, so far as relates to the preliminary
steps to be taken, and is usually permitted to
do so, through the whole proceedings; but
this is a matter of courtesy; every committee
having a right to elect its own chairman, who
presides over it, and makes the report of its
proceedings to the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.274" id="par.274">274</a>. </span>A committee is properly to receive
directions from the assembly, as to the time
and place of its meeting, and cannot regularly
sit at any other time or place; and it
<a name="png.144" id="png.144" href="#png.144"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>may be ordered to sit immediately, whilst the
assembly is sitting, and make its report forthwith.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.275" id="par.275">275</a>. </span>When no directions are given, a committee
may select its own time and place of
meeting; but, without a special order to that
effect, it is not at liberty to sit whilst the
assembly sits; and, if a committee is sitting,
when the assembly comes to order after an
adjournment, it is the duty of the chairman
to rise, instantly, on being certified of it, and,
with the other members, to attend the service
of the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.276" id="par.276">276</a>. </span>In regard to its forms of proceeding,
a committee is essentially a miniature assembly;—it
can only act when regularly assembled
together, as a committee, and not by
separate consultation and consent of the
members; nothing being the agreement or
report of a committee, but what is agreed to
in that manner;—a vote taken in committee
is as binding as a vote of the assembly;—a
majority of the members is necessary to constitute
a quorum for business, unless a larger
or smaller number has been fixed by the assembly
itself;—and a committee has full
power over whatever may be committed to it,
<a name="png.145" id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>147<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>except that it is not at liberty to change the
title or subject.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.277" id="par.277">277</a>. </span>A committee, which is under no directions
as to the time and place of meeting,
may meet when and where it pleases, and adjoin
itself from day to day, or otherwise, until
it has gone through with the business committed
to it; but, if it is ordered to meet at a
particular time, and it fails of doing so, for
any cause, the committee is closed, and cannot
act without being newly directed to sit.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.278" id="par.278">278</a>. </span>Disorderly words spoken in a committee
must be written down in the same manner
as in the assembly; but the committee, as
such, can do nothing more than report them
to the assembly for its animadversion; neither
can a committee punish disorderly conduct
of any other kind, but must report it to the
assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.279" id="par.279">279</a>. </span>When any paper is before a committee
whether select or of the whole, it may either
have originated with the committee, or have
been referred to them; and, in either case,
when the paper comes to be considered, the
course is for it to be first read entirely through,
by the clerk of the committee, if there is one,
otherwise by the chairman; and then to be
<a name="png.146" id="png.146" href="#png.146"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>148<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>read through again by paragraphs by the
chairman, pausing at the end of each paragraph,
and putting questions for amending,
either by striking out or inserting, if proposed.
This is the natural order of proceeding in
considering and amending any paper, and is
to be strictly adhered to in the assembly;
but the same strictness does not seem necessary
in a committee.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.280" id="par.280">280</a>. </span>If the paper before a committee is
one which has originated with the committee,
questions are put on amendments proposed,
but not on agreeing to the several paragraphs
of which it is composed, separately, as they
are gone through with; this being reserved
for the close, when a question is to be put on
the whole, for agreeing to the paper, as
amended, or unamended.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.281" id="par.281">281</a>. </span>If the paper be one, which has been
referred to the committee, they proceed as in
the other case to put questions of amendment,
if proposed, but no final question on
the whole; because all the parts of the paper,
having been passed upon if not adopted by
the assembly as the basis of its action, stand,
of course, unless altered or struck out by a
vote of the assembly. And<!-- TN: original reads "Amd" --> even if the
<a name="png.147" id="png.147" href="#png.147"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>committee<!-- TN: original reads "com-
mitte" --> are opposed to the whole paper, and are
of opinion, that it cannot be made good by
amendments, they have no authority to reject
it; they must report it back to the assembly,
without amendments, (specially stating their
objections, if they think proper,) and there
make their opposition as individual members.<a name="fn37" id="fn37"></a><a title="Go to footnote 37"
 href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.282" id="par.282">282</a>. </span>In the case of a paper originating with
a committee, they may erase or interline it
as much as they please; though, when finally
agreed to, it ought to be reported in a clear
draft, fairly written, without erasure or interlineation.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.283" id="par.283">283</a>. </span>But, in the case of a paper referred to
a committee, they are not at liberty to erase,
interline, blot, disfigure, or tear it, in any
manner; but they must, in a separate paper,
set down the amendments they have agreed
to report, stating the words which are to be
inserted or omitted, and the place where the
amendments are to be made, by references to
the paragraph<!-- TN: original reads "pargraph" --> or section, line, and word.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.284" id="par.284">284</a>. </span>If the amendments agreed to are very
<a name="png.148" id="png.148" href="#png.148"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>150<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>numerous and minute, the committee may report
them altogether, in the form of a new
and amended draft.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.285" id="par.285">285</a>. </span>When a committee has gone through
the paper, or agreed upon a report on the
subject, which has been referred to them, it
is then moved by some member, and thereupon
voted, that the committee rise, and that
the chairman, or some other member, make
their report to the assembly.</p>


<h3 class="sect" title="Section IV. Their Report">Sect. IV. Their Report.</h3>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.286" id="par.286">286</a>. </span>When the report of a committee is to
be made, the chairman, or member appointed
to make the report, standing in his place, informs
the assembly, that the committee, to
whom was referred such a subject or paper,
have, according to order, had the same under
consideration, and have directed him to make
a report thereon, or to report the same with
sundry amendments, or without amendment,
as the case may be, which he is ready to do,
when the assembly shall please; and he or any
other member may then move that the report
be now received. On this motion being made,
the question is put whether the assembly
will receive the report at that time; and a
<a name="png.149" id="png.149" href="#png.149"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>151<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>vote passes, accordingly, either to receive it
then, or fixing upon some future time for its
reception.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.287" id="par.287">287</a>. </span>At the time, when, by the order of
the assembly, the report is to be received, the
chairman reads it in his place, and then delivers
it, together with all the papers, connected
with it, to the clerk at the table; where it
is again read, and then lies on the table, until
the time assigned, or until it suits the convenience
of the assembly, to take it up for consideration.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.288" id="par.288">288</a>. </span>If the report of the committee is of a
paper with amendments, the chairman reads
the amendments with the coherence in the
paper, whatever it may be, and opens the alterations,
and the reasons of the committee
for the amendments, until he has gone through
the whole; and, when the report is read at
the clerk’s table, the amendments only are
read without the coherence.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.289" id="par.289">289</a>. </span>In practice, however, the formality of
a motion and vote on the reception of a report
is usually dispensed with; though, if any objection
is made, or if the presiding officer sees
any informality in the report, he should decline
receiving it without a motion and vote;
<a name="png.150" id="png.150" href="#png.150"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>152<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and a report, if of any considerable length, is
seldom read, either by the chairman in his
place, or by the clerk at the table, until it is
taken up for consideration. In legislative
assemblies, the printing of reports generally
renders the reading of them unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.290" id="par.290">290</a>. </span>The report of a committee being made
and received, the committee is dissolved, and
can act no more without a new power; but
their authority may be revived by a vote, and
the same matter recommitted to them. If a
report, when offered to the assembly, is not
received, the committee is not thereby discharged,
but may be ordered to sit again, and
a time and place appointed accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.291" id="par.291">291</a>. </span>When a subject or paper has been
once committed, and a report made upon it,
it may be recommitted either to the same or
a different committee; and if a report is recommitted,
before it has been agreed to by
the assembly, what has heretofore passed in
the committee is of no validity; the whole
question being again before the committee, as
if nothing had passed there in relation to it.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.292" id="par.292">292</a>. </span>The report of a committee may be
made in three different forms, namely: <i>first</i>,
it may contain merely a statement of facts,
<a name="png.151" id="png.151" href="#png.151"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>153<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>reasoning, or opinion, in relation to the subject
of it, without any specific conclusion; or,
<i>second</i>, a statement of facts, reasoning, or
opinion, concluding with a resolution, or
series of resolutions, or some other specific
proposition; or, <i>third</i>, it may consist merely
of such resolutions, or propositions, without
any introductory part.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.293" id="par.293">293</a>. </span>The first question, on a report, is, in
strictness, on receiving it; though in practice,
this question is seldom or never made;
the consent of the assembly, especially in
respect to the report of a committee of the
whole, being generally presumed, unless objection
is made. When a report is received,
whether by general consent, or upon a question
and vote, the committee is discharged,
and the report becomes the basis of the future
proceedings of the assembly, on the subject
to which it relates.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.294" id="par.294">294</a>. </span>At the time assigned for the consideration
of a report, it may be treated and disposed
of precisely like any other proposition
(<a href="#par.59">59</a> to 77); and may be amended, in the same
manner (<a href="#par.78">78</a> to 133), both in the preliminary
statement, reasoning, or opinion, if it contain
any, and in the resolutions, or other
<a name="png.152" id="png.152" href="#png.152"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>154<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>propositions with which it concludes; so if
it consist merely of a statement, etc.,<!-- TN: comma invisible --> without
resolutions, or of resolutions, etc., without
any introductory part.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.295" id="par.295">295</a>. </span>The final question on a report, whatever
form it may have, is usually stated on
its acceptance; and, when accepted, the
whole report is adopted by the assembly, and
becomes the statement, reasoning, opinion,
resolution, or other act, as the case may be,
of the assembly; the doings of a committee,
when agreed to, adopted, or accepted, becoming
the acts of the assembly, in the same
manner as if done originally by the assembly
itself, without the intervention of a committee.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.296" id="par.296">296</a>. </span>It would be better, however, and in
stricter accordance with parliamentary rules,
to state the final question on a report, according
to the form of it. If the report contain
merely a statement of facts, reasoning, or
opinion, the question should be on acceptance;
if it also conclude with resolutions, or
other specific propositions, of any kind,—the
introductory part being consequently merged
in the conclusion,—the question should be on
agreeing to the resolutions, or on adopting
<a name="png.153" id="png.153" href="#png.153"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>155<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the order, or other proposition, or on passing
or coming to the vote, recommended by the
committee; and the same should be the form
of the question when the report consists
merely of resolutions, etc., without any introductory
part.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.297" id="par.297">297</a>. </span>When a subject has been ordered to
be referred to a committee of the whole, the
form of going from the assembly into committee,
is, for the presiding officer, at the
time appointed for the committee to sit, on
motion made and seconded for the purpose,
to put the question that the assembly do now
resolve itself into a committee of the whole,
to take under consideration such a matter,
naming it. If this question is determined in
the affirmative, the result is declared by the
presiding officer, who, naming some member
to act as chairman of the committee, then
leaves the chair, and takes a seat elsewhere,
like any other member; and the person appointed
chairman seats himself (not in the
chair of the assembly but) at the clerk’s table.<a name="fn38" id="fn38"></a><a title="Go to footnote 38"
 href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>38<span class="ns">]

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.154" id="png.154" href="#png.154"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>156<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.298" id="par.298">298</a>. </span>The chairman named by the presiding
officer is generally acquiesced in by the
committee; though, like all other committees,
a committee of the whole have a right
to elect a chairman for themselves, some
member, by general consent, putting the
question.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.299" id="par.299">299</a>. </span>The same number of members is necessary
to constitute a quorum of a committee
of the whole, as of the assembly; and if the
members present fall below a quorum, at any
time, in the course of the proceedings, the
chairman, on a motion and question, rises,—the
presiding officer thereupon resumes the
chair,—and the chairman informs the assembly
(he can make no other report) of the
cause of the dissolution of the committee.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.300" id="par.300">300</a>. </span>When the assembly is in committee
of the whole, it is the duty of the presiding
officer to remain in the assembly-room, in
order to be at hand to resume the chair, in
case the committee should be broken up by
some disorder, or for want of a quorum, or
should rise, either to report progress, or to
make their final report upon the matter committed
to them.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.301" id="par.301">301</a>. </span>The clerk of the assembly does not
<a name="png.155" id="png.155" href="#png.155"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>157<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>act as clerk of the committee (this is the
duty of the assistant clerk in legislative bodies),
or record in his journal any of the proceedings
or votes of the committee, but only
their report as made to the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.302" id="par.302">302</a>. </span>The proceedings in a committee of
the whole, though, in general, similar to those
in the assembly itself, and in other committees,
are yet different in some respects, the
principal of which are the <span class="nw">following:—</span></p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.303" id="par.303">303</a>. </span><i>First.</i> The previous question cannot
be moved in a committee of the whole. The
only means of avoiding an improper discussion
is, to move that the committee rise; and,
if it is apprehended, that the same discussion
will be attempted on returning again into committee,
the assembly can discharge the committee,
and proceed itself with the business,
keeping down any improper discussion by
means of the previous question.<a name="fn39" id="fn39"></a><a title="Go to footnote 39"
 href="#Footnote39" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></a></p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.304" id="par.304">304</a>. </span><i>Second.</i> A committee of the whole
cannot adjourn, like other committees, to
some other time or place, for the purpose of
<a name="png.156" id="png.156" href="#png.156"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>158<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>going on with and completing the consideration
of the subject referred to them; but if
their business is unfinished, at the usual time
for the assembly to adjourn, or, for any other
reason, they wish to proceed no further at a
particular time, the form of proceeding is, for
some member to move that the committee
rise,—report progress,—and ask leave to sit
again; and, if this motion prevails, the chairman
rises,—the presiding officer resumes the
chair of the assembly,—and the chairman of
the committee informs him that the committee
of the whole have, according to order,
had under their consideration such a matter,
and have made some progress therein;<a name="fn40" id="fn40"></a><a title="Go to footnote 40"
 href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor"><span
 class="ns">[Footnote </span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></a> but,
not having had time to go through with the
same, have directed him to ask leave for the
committee to sit again. The presiding officer
thereupon puts a question on giving the committee
leave to sit again, and also on the time
when, the assembly will again resolve itself
into a committee. If leave to sit again is not
granted, the committee is of course dissolved.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.305" id="par.305">305</a>. </span><i>Third.</i> In a committee of the whole,
every member may speak as often as he
<a name="png.157" id="png.157" href="#png.157"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>159<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pleases, provided he could obtain the floor;
whereas in the assembly itself, no member
can speak more than once.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.306" id="par.306">306</a>. </span><i>Fourth.</i> A committee of the whole
cannot refer any matter to another committee;
but other committees may and do frequently
exercise their functions, and expedite their
business by means of sub-committees of their
own members.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.307" id="par.307">307</a>. </span><i>Fifth.</i> In a committee of the whole,
the presiding officer of the assembly has a
right to take a part in the debate and proceedings,
in the same manner as any other
member.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.308" id="par.308">308</a>. </span><i>Sixth.</i> A committee of the whole, like
a select committee, has no authority to punish
a breach of order whether of a member, or
stranger; but can only rise and report the
matter to the assembly, who may proceed to
punish the offender. Disorderly words must
be written down in committee, in the same
manner as in the assembly, and reported to
the assembly for their animadversion.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.309" id="par.309">309</a>. </span>The foregoing are the principal points
of difference between proceedings in the assembly
and in committees of the whole; in
most other respects they are precisely similar.
<a name="png.158" id="png.158" href="#png.158"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>160<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>It is sometimes said, that in a committee of
the whole, it is not necessary that a motion
should be seconded. There is no foundation,
however, either in reason or parliamentary
usage, for this opinion.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.310" id="par.310">310</a>. </span>When a committee of the whole have
gone through with the matter referred to
them, a member moves that the committee
rise, and that the chairman (or some other
member) report their proceedings to the assembly;
which being resolved, the chairman
rises and goes to his place,—the presiding officer
resumes the chair of the assembly,—and
the chairman informs him, that the committee
have gone through with the business referred
to them, and that he is ready to make their
report, when the assembly shall think proper
to receive it. The time for receiving the
report is then agreed upon; and, at the time
appointed, it is made and received in the same
manner as that of any other committee (<a href="#par.286">286</a>).</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.311" id="par.311">311</a>. </span>It sometimes happens, that the formality
of a motion and question as to the time
of receiving a report is dispensed with. If
the assembly are ready to receive it, at the
time, they cry out, “now, now,” whereupon
the chairman proceeds; if not then ready,
<a name="png.159" id="png.159" href="#png.159"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>161<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>some other time is mentioned, as “to-morrow,”
or “Monday,” and that time is fixed
by general consent. But, when it is not the
general sense of the assembly to receive the
report at the time, it is better to agree upon
and fix the time by a motion and question.<a name="fn41" id="fn41"></a><a title="Go to footnote 41"

<h2 class="runon" title="Concluding Remarks"><a name="conclusion">CONCLUDING REMARKS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.312" id="par.312">312</a>. </span>In bringing this treatise to a close, it
will not be deemed out of place, to make a
suggestion or two for the benefit of those
persons, who may be called upon to act as
presiding officers, for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.313" id="par.313">313</a>. </span>One of the most essential parts of the
duty of a presiding officer is, to give the
closest attention to the proceedings of the
assembly, and, especially, to what is said by
every member who speaks.  Without the
first, confusion will be almost certain to
occur; wasting the time, perhaps disturbing
<a name="png.160" id="png.160" href="#png.160"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>162<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the harmony, of the assembly. The latter is
not merely a decent manifestation of respect
for those who have elevated him to an honorable
station; but it tends greatly to encourage
timid or diffident members, and to secure
them a patient and attentive hearing; and it
often enables the presiding officer, by a timely
interference, to check offensive language, in
season to prevent scenes of tumult and disorder,
such as have sometimes disgraced our
legislative halls.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="par.314" id="par.314">314</a>. </span>It should be constantly kept in mind
by a presiding officer, that, in a deliberative
assembly, there can regularly be but one
thing done or doing, at the same time. This
caution he will find particularly useful to
him, whenever a quarrel arises between two
members, in consequence of words spoken in
debate. In such a case, he will do well to
require that the regular course of proceeding
shall be strictly pursued; and will take care
to restrain members from interfering in any
other manner. In general, the solemnity
and deliberation, with which this mode is
attended, will do much to allay heat and
excitement, and to restore harmony and order
to the assembly.</p>

<p><span class="unjust3"><a name="png.161" id="png.161" href="#png.161"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>163<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><a name="par.315" id="par.315">315</a>. </span>A presiding officer will often find himself
embarrassed, by the difficulty, as well as
the delicacy, of deciding points of order, or
giving directions as to the manner of proceeding.
In such cases, it will be useful for
him to recollect, <span class="nw">that—</span></p>

<p class="smc">The great purpose of all rules and
forms, is to subserve the will of the
assembly rather than to restrain it;
to facilitate, and not to obstruct, the
expression of their deliberate sense.</p>

<p class="tb">————⧓⬬⧓————</p>

<p id="finalnote"><small><span class="smc">Note</span>: The so-called “cloture” has the same end
as the American previous question; it is intended to
cut debate short. The English previous question
works to continue debate, and a new scheme had to
be devised in 1882. Then it was that the French
cloture was adopted and naturalized. Under the
Cloture act the Speaker of the House or the Chairman
of Committee may say when he thinks the subject
before the House or the Committee has been sufficiently
discussed, and<!-- TN: original reads "and and" --> if a motion be made
“That the question be now put,” he shall put the
question. If 200 members are in favor of putting
the question, or if less than 40 oppose it and more
than 100 are in favor, he shall put the question on
the principal question before the House or the committee
at once. In this country, when a member
reports a bill from his committee he moves that the
previous question be put at the end of one hour;
debate is therefore limited to one hour. In England,
<a name="png.162" id="png.162" href="#png.162"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>164<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a member, calling up a bill for its second reading,
moves the previous question, and votes against his
motion. If the previous question should be ordered,
he would feel grievously disgusted—so would the
American Congressman, if the previous question
should not be ordered.</small></p>

 /></span></span></a>DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<p><span class="smc">When</span>, in the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one people to dissolve the political
bands which have connected them with another,
and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the
separate and equal station to which the laws of
Nature and Nature’s God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that
they should declare the causes which impel them to
the separation.</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all
men are created equal; that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. That to secure these rights, governments
are instituted among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed; that
whenever any form of government becomes destructive
of these ends, it is the right of the people
to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government,
laying its foundation on such principles,
and organizing its powers in such form as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their safety and
<a name="png.188" id="png.188" href="#png.188"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>190<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that
governments long established should not be changed
for light and transient causes; and accordingly all
experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed
to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to
right themselves, by abolishing the forms to which
they are accustomed. But when a long train of
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
same object, evinces a design to reduce them under
absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such government, and to provide new
guards for their future security. Such has been
the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is
now the necessity which constrains them to alter
their former systems of government. The history
of the present king of Great Britain is a history of
repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in
direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny
over these States. To prove this, let facts be
submitted to a candid world:</p>

<p>He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome
and necessary for the public good.</p>

<p>He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of
immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended
in their operation till his assent should be
obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly
neglected to attend to them. He has refused to
pass other laws for the accommodation of large
districts of people, unless those people would relinquish
the right of representation in the legislature—a
right inestimable to them, and formidable to
tyrants only.</p>

<p><a name="png.189" id="png.189" href="#png.189"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>191<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>He has called together legislative bodies at places
unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the repository
of the public records, for the sole purpose
of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly
for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasions on
the rights of the people.</p>

<p>He has refused for a long time after such dissolution
to cause others to be elected; whereby the
legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have
returned to the people at large for their exercise,
the State remaining, in the mean time, exposed to
all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions
within.</p>

<p>He has endeavored to prevent the population of
these States; for that purpose obstructing the laws
of naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass
others to encourage their migration hither, and
raising the conditions of new appropriations of
lands.</p>

<p>He has obstructed the administration of justice
by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary
powers.</p>

<p>He has made judges dependent on his will alone
for the tenure of their offices and the amount of
payment of their salaries.</p>

<p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and
sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people,
and eat out their substance.</p>

<p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing
armies, without the consent of our legislatures.</p>

<p><a name="png.190" id="png.190" href="#png.190"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>192<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>He has affected to render the military independent
of and superior to the civil power.</p>

<p>He has combined with others to subject us to a
jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged
by our laws; giving his assent to
their acts of pretended legislation:</p>

<p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops
among us:</p>

<p>For protecting them by a mock trial from punishment
for any murders which they should commit
on the inhabitants of these States:</p>

<p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the
world:</p>

<p>For imposing taxes on us without our consent:</p>

<p>For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits
of trial by jury:</p>

<p>For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for
pretended offences:</p>

<p>For abolishing the free system of English laws in
a neighboring province, establishing therein an
arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries,
so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument
for introducing the same absolute rule into
these colonies:</p>

<p>For taking away, our charters, abolishing our
most valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally,
the forms of our government:</p>

<p>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring
themselves invested with power to legislate for
us in all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p>He has abdicated government here by declaring
us out of his protection, and waging war against us.</p>

<p><a name="png.191" id="png.191" href="#png.191"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>193<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts,
burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our
people.</p>

<p>He is at this time transporting large armies of
foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death,
desolation, and tyranny already begun, with circumstances
of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled
in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy
the head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p>He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken
captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their
country, to become the executioners of their friends
and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.</p>

<p>He has excited domestic insurrections among us,
and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of
our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose
known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction
of all ages, sexes, and conditions.</p>

<p>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned
for redress in the most humble terms; our
repeated petitions have been answered only by
repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus
marked by every act which may define a tyrant is
unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

<p>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our
British brethren. We have warned them, from
time to time, of attempts by their legislature to
extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We
have reminded them of the circumstances of our
emigration and settlement here. We have appealed
to their native justice and magnanimity, and we
have conjured them by the ties of our common
<a name="png.192" id="png.192" href="#png.192"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>194<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would
inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
They, too, have been deaf to the voice
of justice and consanguinity. We must, therefore,
acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our
separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of
mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.</p>

<p>We, therefore, the representatives of the United
States of America, in General Congress assembled,
appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for
the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and
by the authority of the good people of these colonies,
solemnly publish and declare that these
United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent States; that they are absolved from
all allegiance to the British crown, and that all
political connection between them and the State of
Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved;
and that, as free and independent States, they have
full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract
alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other
acts and things which independent States may of
right do. And for the support of this declaration,
with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our
lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="noindent"><em>Friends and Fellow-Citizens:</em></p>

<p>The period for a new election of a citizen to administer
the executive government of the United
States, being not far distant, and the time actually
arrived when your thoughts must be employed in
designating the person who is to be clothed with
that important trust, it appears to me proper, especially
as it may conduce to a more distinct expression
of the public voice, that I should now apprise
you of the resolution I have formed, to decline being
considered among the number of those out of whom
the choice is to be made.</p>

<p>I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to
be assured, that this resolution has not been taken,
without a strict regard to all the considerations appertaining
to the relation which binds a dutiful citizen
to his country; and that in withdrawing the tender
of service, which silence in my situation might
imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for
your future interest; no deficiency of grateful respect
for your past kindness; but am supported by a full
conviction, that the step is compatible with both.</p>

<p>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in,
the office to which your suffrages have twice called
me, have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to
the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared
to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it
would have been much earlier in my power, consistently
with motives which I was not at liberty to
disregard, to return to that retirement from which I
had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my
inclination to do this, previous to the last election,
had even led to the preparation of an address to declare
it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed
and critical posture of our affairs with foreign
nations, and the unanimous advice of persons entitled
to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the
<a name="png.208" id="png.208" href="#png.208"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>210<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>idea. I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external
as well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit
of inclination incompatible with the sentiment
of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever
partiality may be retained for my services, that in
the present circumstances of our country, you will
not disapprove of my determination to retire.</p>

<p>The impressions with which I first undertook the
arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion.
In the discharge of this trust I will only say
that I have, with good intentions, contributed toward
the organization and administration of the government
the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment
was capable. Not unconscious, in the outset,
of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in
my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of
others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of
myself; and every day the increasing weight of years
admonishes me more and more, that the shade of retirement
is as necessary to me as it will be welcome.
Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar
value to my services, they were temporary, I
have the consolation to believe, that while choice
and prudence invite me to quit the political scene,
patriotism does not forbid it.</p>

<p>In looking forward to the moment which is to terminate
the career of my political life, my feelings do
not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment
of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved
country, for the many honors it has conferred upon
me; still more for the steadfast confidence with
which it has supported me; and for the opportunities
I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable
attachment, by services faithful and persevering,
though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits
have resulted to our country from these services, let
it always be remembered to your praise, and as an
instructive example in our annals, that under circumstances
in which the passions agitated in every
direction, were liable to mislead—amidst appearances
sometimes dubious—vicissitudes of fortune
often discouraging—in situations in which not
<a name="png.209" id="png.209" href="#png.209"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>211<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>unfrequently want of success has countenanced the
spirit of criticism—the constancy of your support
was the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee
of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly
penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it
with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceasing
wishes, that Heaven may continue to you the
choicest tokens of its beneficence—that your union
and brotherly affection may be perpetual—that the
free constitution which is the work of your hands,
may be sacredly maintained—that its administration
in every department may be stamped with wisdom
and virtue—that, in fine, the happiness of the people
of these States, under the auspices of liberty, may
be made complete, by so careful a preservation and
so prudent a use of this blessing, as will acquire to
them the glory of recommending it to the applause,
the affection, and the adoption of every nation
which is yet a stranger to it.</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude
for your welfare, which can not end but with my
life, and the apprehension of danger natural to that
solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present,
to offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend
to your frequent view, some sentiments, which
are the result of much reflection, of no inconsiderable
observation, and which appear to me all-important
to the permanency of your felicity as a people.
These will be offered to you with the more freedom,
as you can only see in them the disinterested warning
of a parting friend, who can possibly have no
personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget
as an encouragement<!-- TN: original reads "encouragment", Ngram suggests this would be uncommon even in 1796 --> to it your indulgent reception
of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar
occasion.</p>

<p>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every
ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of
mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</p>

<p>The unity of government, which constitutes you
one people, is also now dear to you. It is justly so;
for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence;
the support of your tranquillity at
<a name="png.210" id="png.210" href="#png.210"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>212<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>home; your peace abroad; of your safety, of your
prosperity; of that very liberty which you so highly
prize. But as it is easy to foresee, that from different
causes and from different quarters, much pains
will be taken, many artifices employed to weaken
in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this
is the point in your political fortress against which
the batteries of internal and external enemies will
be most constantly and actively (though often
covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite
moment that you should properly estimate the immense
value of your national union, to your collective
and individual happiness; that you should
cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment
to it; accustom yourself to think and speak of
it as of the palladium of your political safety and
prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous
anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest
even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned;
and indignantly frowning upon the first
dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of
our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred
ties which now link together the various parts.</p>

<p>For this you have every inducement of sympathy
and interest. Citizens by birth or choice of a common
country, that country has a right to concentrate
your affections. The name of <span class="smc">American</span>, which
belongs to you in your national capacity, must
always exalt the just pride of patriotism, more than
any appellation derived from local discriminations.
With slight shades of difference, you have the same
religion, manners, habits, and political principles.
You have in a common cause fought and triumphed
together; the independence and liberty you possess
are the work of joint councils and joint efforts—of
common dangers, sufferings, and successes.</p>

<p>But these considerations, however powerfully they
address themselves to your sensibility, are greatly
outweighed by those which apply more immediately
to your interest. Here every portion of our country
finds the most commanding motives for carefully
guarding and preserving the union of the whole.</p>

<p><a name="png.211" id="png.211" href="#png.211"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>213<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>The <em>north</em>, in an unrestrained intercourse with the
<em>south</em>, protected by the equal laws of a common government,
finds in the productions of the latter, great
additional resources of maritime and commercial
enterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing
industry. The <em>south</em>, in the same intercourse, benefiting
by the agency of the <em>north</em>, sees its agriculture
grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly
into its own channels the seamen of the <em>north</em>, it
finds its particular navigation invigorated—and
while it contributes, in different ways, to nourish
and increase the general mass of the national navigation,
it looks forward to the protection of a maritime
strength, to which itself is equally adapted.
The <em>east</em>, in like intercourse with the <em>west</em>, already
finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior
communications, by land and water, will more
and more find a valuable vent for the commodities
which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at
home. The <em>west</em> derives from the <em>east</em> supplies
requisite to its growth and comfort—and, what is of
perhaps still greater consequence, it must of necessity
owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets
for its own productions, to the weight, influence,
and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic
side of the union, directed by an indissoluble community
of interest as one nation. Any other tenure
by which the <em>west</em> can hold this essential advantage,
whether derived from its own separate strength, or
from an apostate and unnatural connection with any
foreign power, must be intrinsically precarious.</p>

<p>While then every part of our country thus feels
an immediate and particular interest in union, all the
parts combined can not fail to find in the united
mass of means and efforts, greater strength, greater
resources, proportionately greater security from external
danger, a less frequent interruption of their
peace by foreign nations; and, what is of inestimable
value, they must derive from union an exemption
from those broils and wars between themselves,
which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not
tied together by the same government which their
<a name="png.212" id="png.212" href="#png.212"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>214<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce;
but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments,
and intrigues would stimulate and imbitter. Hence,
likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those over-grown
military establishments, which, under any
form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and
which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to
republican liberty. In this sense it is that your
union ought to be considered as a main prop of your
liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear
to you the preservation of the other.</p>

<p>These considerations speak a persuasive language
to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit
the continuance of the union as a primary object of
patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common
government can embrace so large a sphere? Let
experience solve it. To listen to mere speculation
in such a case were criminal. We are authorized to
hope that a proper organization of the whole, with
the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective
subdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the
experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment.
With such powerful and obvious motives to
union affecting all parts of our country, while experience
shall not have demonstrated its impracticability,
there will always be reason to distrust the
patriotism of those who, in any quarter, may endeavor
to weaken its bands.</p>

<p>In contemplating the causes which may disturb
our union, it occurs as matter of serious concern,
that any ground should have been furnished for
characterizing parties by geographical discriminations—<em>Northern</em>
and <em>Southern</em>—<em>Atlantic</em> and <em>Western</em>;
whence designing men may endeavor to excite
a belief that there is  real difference of local interests
and views. One of the expedients of party to
acquire influence, within particular districts, is to
misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts.
You can not shield yourselves too much
against the jealousies and heart-burnings which
spring from these misrepresentations;<!-- TN: original unclear, could be colon --> they tend to
render alien to each other those who ought to be
<a name="png.213" id="png.213" href="#png.213"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>215<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants
of our western country have lately had a useful
lesson on this head. They have seen, in the negotiation
by the executive, and in the unanimous ratification
by the senate, of the treaty with Spain, and
in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout
the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded
were the suspicion propagated among them of a
policy in the general government, and in the Atlantic
States unfriendly to their interests in regard to the
Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation
of two treaties—that with Great Britain
and that with Spain—which secure to them everything
they could desire in respect to our foreign
relations toward confirming their prosperity. Will
it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of
these advantages on the union by which they were
procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to
those advisers, if such there are, who would sever
them from their brethren and connect them with
aliens?</p>

<p>To the efficacy and permanency of your union, a
government for the whole is indispensable. No
alliances, however strict, between the parts can be
an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience
the infractions and interruptions which all
alliances in all times have experienced. Sensible of
this momentous truth, you have improved upon your
first essay, by the adoption of a constitution of government
better calculated than your former, for an
intimate union, and for the efficacious management
of your common concerns. This government—the
offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced and
unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature
deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the
distribution of its powers uniting security with
energy, and containing within itself a provision for
its own amendments—has a just claim to your confidence
and your support. Respect for its authority,
compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures,
are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims
of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is
<a name="png.214" id="png.214" href="#png.214"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>216<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the right of the people to make and to alter their
constitutions of government. But the constitution
which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit
and authentic act of the whole people, is
sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the
power and the right of the people to establish a government,
presupposes the duty of every individual
to obey the established government.</p>

<p>All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all
combinations and associations, under whatever
plausible character, with the real design to direct,
control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberations
and actions of the constituted authorities, are destructive
of this fundamental principle, and of fatal
tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give
it an artificial and extraordinary force, to put in the
place of the delegated will of the nation the will of
a party, often a small but artful and enterprising
minority of the community; and, according to the
alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the
public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted
and incongruous projects of faction, rather
than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans,
digested by common councils, and modified by
mutual interests.</p>

<p>However combinations or associations of the above
description may now and then answer popular ends,
they are likely, in the course of time and things, to
become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious,
and unprincipled men, will be enabled to subvert the
power of the people, and to usurp for themselves
the reins of government, destroying afterward the
very engines which have lifted them to unjust
dominion.</p>

<p>Towards the preservation of your government, and
the permanency of your present happy state, it is
requisite not only that you steadily discountenance
irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority,
but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation
upon its principles, however specious the pretexts.
One method of assault may be to effect in the
forms of the constitution alterations which will
<a name="png.215" id="png.215" href="#png.215"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>217<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine
what can not be directly overthrown. In all
the changes to which you may be invited, remember
that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix
the true character of governments as of other human
institutions—that experience is the surest standard
by which to test the real tendency of the existing
constitution of a country—that facility in changes
upon the credit of a mere hypothesis and opinion,
exposes to perpetual change from the endless variety
of hypothesis and opinion; and remember especially
that for the efficient management of your common
interests, in a country so extensive as ours, a government
of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect
security of liberty, is indispensable. Liberty
itself will find in such a government, with powers
properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian.
It is, indeed, little else than a name, where
the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises
of faction, to confine each member of the
society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and
to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment
of the rights of person and property.</p>

<p>I have already intimated to you the danger of parties
in the state, with particular references to the
founding of them on geographical discriminations.
Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and
warn you in the most solemn manner against the
baneful effects of the spirit of party, generally.</p>

<p>This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our
nature, having its root in the strongest passions of
the human mind. It exists under different shapes
in all governments, more or less stifled or controlled
or repressed; but in those of the popular
form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is
truly their worst enemy.</p>

<p>The alternate domination of one faction over
another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural
to party dissension, which in different ages and countries
has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is
itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at
length to a more formal and permanent despotism.
<a name="png.216" id="png.216" href="#png.216"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>218<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The disorders and miseries which result, gradually
incline the minds of men to seek security and
repose in the absolute power of an individual: and
sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction,
more able or more fortunate than his competitors,
turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation,
on the ruins of public liberty.</p>

<p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this
kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out
of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the
spirit of party, are sufficient to make it the interest
and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.</p>

<p>It serves always to distract the public councils, and
enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the
community with ill-founded jealousies and false
alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against
another; foments occasional riot and insurrection.
It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption,
which find a facilitated access to the government
itself through the channels of party passions. Thus
the policy and the will of one country are subjected
to the policy and will of another.</p>

<p>There is an opinion that parties in free countries
are useful checks upon the administration of the
government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of
liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably
true; and in governments of a monarchical cast,
patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with
favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those
of the popular character, in governments purely
elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From
their natural tendency it is certain there will always
be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose.
And there being constant danger of excess, the
effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to
mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched,
it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting
into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should
consume.</p>

<p>It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking
in a free country should inspire caution in those
intrusted with its administration, to confine
<a name="png.217" id="png.217" href="#png.217"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>219<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>themselves within their respective constitutional spheres,
avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department
to encroach upon another. The spirit of the
encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all
the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever
the form of government, a real despotism. A just
estimate of that love of power, and proneness to
abuse it, which predominate in the human heart, is
sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position.
The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of
the political power, by dividing and distributing it
into different depositaries, and constituting each the
guardian of the public weal against invasions by the
others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and
modern; some of them in our country, and under
our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary
as to institute them. If, in the opinion of the
people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional
powers be, in any particular, wrong, let it
be corrected by an amendment in the way which the
constitution designates; but let there be no change
by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may
be the instrument of good, it is the customary
weapon by which free governments are destroyed.
The precedent must always greatly overbalance, in
permanent evil, any partial or transient benefit which
the use can at any time yield.</p>

<p>Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to
political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable
supports. In vain would that man claim
the tribute of patriotism, who would labor to subvert
these great pillars of human happiness, these
firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The
mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought
to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not
trace all their connections with private and public
felicity. Let it simply be asked where is the security
for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of
religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments
of investigation in courts of justice? And
let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality
can be maintained without religion. Whatever
<a name="png.218" id="png.218" href="#png.218"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>220<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>may be conceded of the influence of refined education
on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience
both forbid us to expect that national
morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.</p>

<p>It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a
necessary spring of popular government. The rule
indeed extends with more or less force to every species
of free government. Who that is a sincere
friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts
to shake the foundation of the fabric?</p>

<p>Promote, then, as an object of primary importance,
institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge.
In proportion as the structure of a government
gives force to public opinion, it is essential that
public opinion should be enlightened.</p>

<p>As a very important source of strength and
security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving
it is to use it as sparingly as possible, avoiding
occasions of expense, by cultivating peace, but
remembering also that timely disbursements, to
prepare for dangers, frequently prevent much
greater disbursements, to repel it; avoiding likewise
the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning
occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions
in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable
wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously
throwing upon posterity the burden which we
ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these
maxims belongs to your representatives, but it is
necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To
facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is
essential that you should practically bear in mind
that toward the payment of debts there must be
revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes;
and no taxes can be devised which are not more or
less inconvenient and unpleasant; that the intrinsic
embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the
proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties)
ought to be a decisive motive for a candid
construction of the conduct of the government in
making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the
<a name="png.219" id="png.219" href="#png.219"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>221<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies
may at any time dictate.</p>

<p>Observe good faith and justice toward all nations;
cultivate peace and harmony with all. Religion and
morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be that
good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be
worthy of a free, enlightened, and (at no distant
period) a great nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous
and novel example of a people always
guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who
can doubt that, in the course of time and things, the
fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary
advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence
to it? Can it be that Providence has not
connected the permanent felicity of a nation with
virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended
by every sentiment which ennobles human nature.
Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?</p>

<p>In the execution of such a plan, nothing is more
essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies
against particular nations, and passionate attachments
for others, should be excluded; and that, in
the place of them, just and amicable feelings towards
all should be cultivated. The nation which indulges
towards another an habitual hatred, or an
habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is
a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of
which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty
and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against
another disposes each more readily to offer insult and
injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and
to be haughty and intractable when accidental or
trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence, frequent
collisions, obstinate, envenomed and bloody contests.
The nation, prompted by ill-will and resentment,
sometimes impels to war the government, contrary
to the best calculations of policy. The government
sometimes participates in the national
propensity, and adopts, through passion, what reason
would reject; at other times it makes the animosity
of the nation subservient to projects of hostility, instigated
by pride, ambition, and other sinister and
<a name="png.220" id="png.220" href="#png.220"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>222<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps
the liberty of nations, has been the victim.</p>

<p>So, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation
for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy
for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an
imaginary common interest, in cases where no real
common interest exists, and infusing into one the
enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation
in the quarrels and wars of the latter without
adequate inducement or justification. It leads
also to concessions to the favorite nation, of privileges
denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure
the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily
parting with what ought to have been retained, and
by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate
in the parties from whom equal privileges are
withheld; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted or
deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the
favorite nation) facility to betray, or sacrifice the
interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes
even with popularity, gilding with the appearances
of a virtuous sense of obligation a commendable
deference for public opinion, or a laudable
zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances
of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.</p>

<p>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable
ways, such attachments are particularly alarming to
the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How
many opportunities do they afford to tamper with
domestic factions, to practice the arts of seduction,
to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the
public councils; such an attachment of a small or
weak, toward a great and powerful nation, dooms
the former to be the satellite of the latter.</p>

<p>Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence
(I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens), the
jealousy of a free people ought to be <em>constantly</em>
awake; since history and experience prove that foreign
influence is one of the most baneful foes of
republican government. But that jealousy, to be
useful, must be impartial, else it becomes the instrument
of the very influence to be avoided, instead of
<a name="png.221" id="png.221" href="#png.221"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>223<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one
foreign nation and excessive dislike of another,
cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on
one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts
of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may
resist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to
become suspected and odious, while its tools and
dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the
people to surrender their interests. The great rule
of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is,
in extending our commercial relations, to have with
them as little <em>political</em> connection as possible. So
far as we have already formed engagements, let
them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let
us stop.</p>

<p>Europe has a set of primary interests which to us
have none, or a very remote relation. Hence, she
must be engaged in frequent controversies, the
causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns.
Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to
implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary
vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations
and collisions of her friendships or her
enmities.</p>

<p>Our detached and distant situation invites and
enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain
one people, under an efficient government, the
period is not far off when we may defy material injury
from external annoyance; when we may take
such an attitude as will cause the neutrality, we may
at any time resolve upon, to be scrupulously respected;
when belligerent nations, under the impossibility
of making acquisitions upon us, will not
lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we
may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by
justice, shall counsel.</p>

<p>Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation?
Why quit our own to stand upon foreign
ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with
that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and
prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship,
interest, humor, or caprice?</p>

<p><a name="png.222" id="png.222" href="#png.222"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>224<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent
alliances with any portion of the foreign world, so
far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for
let me not be understood as capable of patronizing
infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the
maxim no less applicable to public than to private
affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat
it, therefore, let those engagements be observed
in their genuine sense: but, in my opinion, it is unnecessary,
and would be unwise to extend them.</p>

<p>Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable
establishments, on a respectable defensive posture,
we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary
emergencies.</p>

<p>Harmony and a liberal intercourse with all nations
are recommended by policy, humanity, and interest.
But even our commercial policy should hold an
equal and impartial hand, neither seeking nor
granting exclusive favors or preferences, consulting
the natural course of things, diffusing and diversifying,
by gentle means, the streams of commerce,
but forcing nothing; establishing, with the powers
so disposed, in order to give trade a staple course, to
define the rights of our merchants, and to enable
government to support them, conventional rules of
intercourse, the best that present circumstances and
mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and
liable to be, from time to time, abandoned or varied,
as experience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly
keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation
to look for disinterested favors from another; that it
must pay, with a portion of its independence, for
whatever it may accept under that character; that
by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition
of having given equivalents for nominal
favors, and yet of being reproached with ingratitude
for not giving more. There can be no greater error
than to expect or calculate upon real favors from
nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience
must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.</p>

<p>In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels
of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope
<a name="png.223" id="png.223" href="#png.223"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>225<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>they will make the strong and lasting impression I
could wish; that they will control the usual current
of the passions, or prevent our nation from running
the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of
nations; but, if I may even flatter myself that they
may be productive of some partial benefit, some
occasional good; that they may now and then recur
to moderate the fury of party spirit; to warn against
the mischiefs of foreign intrigue; to guard against
the impostures of pretended patriotism; this hope
will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your
welfare by which they have been dictated.</p>

<p>How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I
have been guided by the principles which have been
delineated, the public records and other evidences of
my conduct must witness to you and to the world.
To myself the assurance of my own conscience is,
that I have at least believed myself to be guided by
them.</p>

<p>In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe,
my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1793, is the
index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving
voice, and by that of your representatives in both
houses of Congress, the spirit of that measure has
continually governed me, uninfluenced by any
attempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>

<p>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the
best lights I could obtain, I was well satisfied that
our country, under all the circumstances of the
case, had a right to take—and was bound in duty
and interest to take—a neutral position. Having
taken it, I determined, as far as should depend on
me, to maintain it with moderation, perseverance,
and firmness.</p>

<p>The considerations which respect the right to hold
this conduct, it is not necessary on this occasion to
detail. I will only observe that, according to my
understanding of the matter, that right, so far from
being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has
been virtually admitted by all.</p>

<p>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred,
without anything more, from the obligation
<a name="png.224" id="png.224" href="#png.224"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[p</span>226<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which justice and humanity impose on every nation,
in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate
the relations of peace and amity toward other
nations.</p>

<p>The inducement of interests for observing that
conduct will best be referred to your own reflections
and experience. With me, a predominant motive
has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to
settle and mature its yet recent institutions, and to
progress, without interruption, to that degree of
strength and consistency which is necessary to give
it, humanly speaking, the command of its own
fortunes.</p>

<p>Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration,
I am unconscious of intentional error, I am,
nevertheless, too sensible of my defects not to think
it probable that I may have committed many errors.
Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the
Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they
may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that
my country will never cease to view them with indulgence;
and that after forty-five years of my life
dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the
faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to
oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of
rest.</p>

<p>Relying on its kindness in this as in other things,
and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which
is so natural to a man who views in it the native
soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations,
I anticipate with phasing expectation that
retreat in which I promise myself to realize, without
alloy, the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the
midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of
good laws under a free government—the ever favorite
object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I
trust, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.</p>
